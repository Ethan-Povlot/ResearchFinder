However, from the aspect of agency costs between management andshareholders (i.e. the first type) and between major shareholders and minorityshareholders (i.e. the second type), the interests of management, shareholdersand creditors will be unbalanced with the change of the marginal utility ofexecutive equity incentives.In order to establish the correlation between theproportion of shares held by executives and investments in corporateinnovation, we have chosen a range of publicly listed companies within China'sA-share market as the focus of our study. Employing a multi-variable linearregression model, we aim to analyze this relationship thoroughly.The followingmodels were developed: (1) the impact model of executive shareholding oncorporate innovation investment; (2) the impact model of executive shareholdingon two types of agency costs; (3)The model is employed to examine the mediatinginfluence of the two categories of agency costs. Following both correlation andregression analyses, the findings confirm a meaningful and positive correlationbetween executives' shareholding and the augmentation of corporate innovationinvestments. Additionally, the results indicate that executive shareholdingcontributes to the reduction of the first type of agency cost, therebyfostering corporate innovation investment. However, simultaneously, it leads toan escalation in the second type of agency cost, thus impeding corporateinnovation investment.",['tanglihua@hnchasing.com'],2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10986

Such systems hasreceived considerable backlash in recent years due to its inequitable allotmentand allocative inefficiency. We analyze a ticketing protocol based on avariation of the marginal price auction system. Users submit bids to theprotocol based on their own utilities. The protocol awards tickets to thehighest bidders and determines the final ticket price paid by all bidders usingthe lowest winning submitted bid. Game theoretic proof is provided to ensurethe protocol more efficiently allocates the tickets to the bidders with thehighest utilities. We also prove that the protocol extracts more economic rentsfor the event organizers and the non-optimality of ticket scalping undertime-invariant bidder utilities.,"['IC', 'boxiangf@student.unimelb.edu.au']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11189

AsTransformer achieved great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP),researchers got interested in Transformer's performance on time seriesprediction, and plenty of Transformer-based solutions on long time seriesforecasting have come out recently. However, when it comes to financial timeseries prediction, LSTM is still a dominant architecture. Therefore, thequestion this study wants to answer is: whether the Transformer-based model canbe applied in financial time series prediction and beat LSTM.To answer this question, various LSTM-based and Transformer-based models arecompared on multiple financial prediction tasks based on high-frequency limitorder book data. A new LSTM-based model called DLSTM is built and newarchitecture for the Transformer-based model is designed to adapt for financialprediction. The experiment result reflects that the Transformer-based modelonly has the limited advantage in absolute price sequence prediction.

In an axiomatic way, we discussconditions on the uncertainty sets that lead to well-known properties ofdynamic robust risk measures, such as convexity and coherence. Furthermore, wediscuss the necessary and sufficient properties of dynamic uncertainty setsthat lead to time-consistencies of robust dynamic risk measures.

Asparse portfolio is desirable over a full portfolio in terms of transactioncost reduction and avoiding illiquid assets. To enforce the sparsity of theportfolio, conventional studies have proposed formulations based on$\ell_p$-norm regularizations as a continuous surrogate of the $\ell_0$-normregularization. Although such formulations can be used to construct sparseportfolios, they are not easy to use in actual investments because parametertuning to specify the exact upper bound on the number of assets in theportfolio is delicate and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a newproblem formulation of sparse index tracking using an $\ell_0$-norm constraintthat enables easy control of the upper bound on the number of assets in theportfolio. In addition, our formulation allows the choice between portfoliosparsity and turnover sparsity constraints, which also reduces transactioncosts by limiting the number of assets that are updated at each rebalancing.Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm for solving this problem basedon a primal-dual splitting method.

Since streaming data is dynamic in nature, to keeptrack of different operations, we have converted the IoT data into an RDFdataset. The RDF dataset is ingested to Apache Kafka for streaming purposes andfor stored data we have used the GraphDB tool that extracts information withthe help of SPARQL query.

Estimating OUD risk prior to prescription could improve the efficacy oftreatment regimens, monitoring programs, and intervention strategies, but riskestimation is typically based on self-reported data or questionnaires. Wedevelop an experimental design and computational methods that combines geneticvariants associated with OUD with behavioral features extracted from GPS andWi-Fi spatiotemporal coordinates to assess OUD risk. Since both OUD mobilityand genetic data do not exist for the same cohort, we develop algorithms to (1)generate mobility features from empirical distributions and (2) synthesizemobility and genetic samples assuming a level of comorbidity and relativerisks. We show that integrating genetic and mobility modalities improves riskmodelling using classification accuracy, area under the precision-recall andreceiver operator characteristic curves, and $F_1$ score. Interpreting thefitted models suggests that mobility features have more influence on OUD risk,although the genetic contribution was significant, particularly in linearmodels. While there exists concerns with respect to privacy, security, bias,and generalizability that must be evaluated in clinical trials before beingimplemented in practice, our framework provides preliminary evidence thatbehavioral and genetic features may improve OUD risk estimation to assist withpersonalized clinical decision-making.","['TU', 'IC', 'OU', 'ND']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10837

The majority of past research on AI andhuman decision-making has concentrated on model explainability andinterpretability. We implemented instance-based UQ for three real datasets. Toachieve this, we trained different AI models for classification for eachdataset, and used random samples generated around the neighborhood of the giveninstance to create confidence intervals for UQ. The computed UQ was calibratedusing a strictly proper scoring rule as a form of quality assurance for UQ. Wethen conducted two preregistered online behavioral experiments that comparedobjective human decision-making performance under different AI informationconditions, including UQ. In Experiment 1, we compared decision-making for noAI (control), AI prediction alone, and AI prediction with a visualization ofUQ. We found UQ significantly improved decision-making beyond the other twoconditions. In Experiment 2, we focused on comparing different representationsof UQ information: Point vs. distribution of uncertainty and visualization type(needle vs. dotplot). We did not find meaningful differences in decision-makingperformance among these different representations of UQ.

However, users and developers often want torecognize new, unseen gestures. This is challenging due to the vast diversityof all plausible hand shapes, e.g. it is impossible for developers to includeall hand gestures in a predefined list. In this paper, we present auser-friendly framework that lets users easily customize and deploy their owngesture recognition pipeline. Our framework provides a pre-trained single-handembedding model that can be fine-tuned for custom gesture recognition. Userscan perform gestures in front of a webcam to collect a small amount of imagesper gesture. We also offer a low-code solution to train and deploy the customgesture recognition model. This makes it easy for users with limited MLexpertise to use our framework. We further provide a no-code web front-end forusers without any ML expertise. This makes it even easier to build and test theend-to-end pipeline. The resulting custom HGR is then ready to be run on-devicefor real-time scenarios.

It is unclear whether these models have encoded atmospheric dynamics,or simply pattern matching that produces the smallest forecast error. Answeringthis question is crucial to establishing the utility of these models as toolsfor basic science. Here we subject one such model, Pangu-weather, to a set offour classical dynamical experiments that do not resemble the model trainingdata. Localized perturbations to the model output and the initial conditionsare added to steady time-averaged conditions, to assess the propagation speedand structural evolution of signals away from the local source. Perturbing themodel physics by adding a steady tropical heat source results in a classicalMatsuno--Gill response near the heating, and planetary waves that radiate intothe extratropics. A localized disturbance on the winter-averaged North Pacificjet stream produces realistic extratropical cyclones and fronts, including thespontaneous emergence of polar lows. Perturbing the 500hPa height field aloneyields adjustment from a state of rest to one of wind--pressure balance over ~6hours. Localized subtropical low pressure systems produce Atlantic hurricanes,provided the initial amplitude exceeds about 5 hPa, and setting the initialhumidity to zero eliminates hurricane development.

Inthis setting, the fundamental information that each agent has, i.e., theinformation structure of the interaction, is determined by the preciseconfigurations in which agents come into view of one another. Occlusionsprevent the use of existing pure feedback solutions, which assume availabilityof the state information of all agents at every time step. On the other hand,existing open-loop solutions only assume availability of the initial agentstates. Thus, they do not fully utilize the information available to agentsduring periods of unhampered visibility. Here, we first introduce an algorithmfor solving an occluded, linear-quadratic (LQ) dynamic game, which computesNash equilibrium by using hybrid information and switching between feedback andopen-loop information structures. We then design an efficient iterativealgorithm for decision-making which exploits this hybrid information structure.Our method is demonstrated in overtaking and intersection traffic scenarios.Results confirm that our method outputs trajectories with favorable runningtimes, converging much faster than recent methods employing reachabilityanalysis.","['University of Texas', 'The University of Texas at Austin ', 'kushagrag@utexas.edu', 'ODU', 'UC', 'The U', 'University of Texas at Austin', 'The University of Texas', 'USA', 'dfk@utexas.edu']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10901

We evaluated the abilityof a mobile app, All_Aboard, to guide BVI travelers precisely to the bus-stops.Methods: The All_Aboard app detected bus-stop signs in real-time via smartphonecamera using a neural network model, and provided distance coded audio feedbackto help localize the detected sign. BVI individuals used the All_Aboard andGoogle Maps app to localize 10 bus-stop locations in Boston downtown andanother 10 in a sub-urban area. For each bus stop, the subjects used the appsto navigate as close as possible to the physical bus-stop sign, starting from30 to 50 meters away. The outcome measures were success rate and gap distancebetween the app-indicated location and the actual physical location of the busstop. Results: The study was conducted with 24 legally blind participants (meanage [SD]: 51[14] years; 11 (46%) Female). The success rate of the All_Aboardapp (91%) was significantly higher than the Google Maps (52%, p<0.001). The gapdistance when using the All_Aboard app was significantly lower (mean [95%CI]:1.8 [1.2-2.3] meters) compared to the Google Maps (7 [6.5-7.5] meters;p<0.001).

Our extractor requires min-entropy$k\geq n - \frac{\sqrt{\log n}}{(d\log \log n)^{d/2}}$. Previously, noconstructions were known, even for min-entropy $k\geq n-1$. A key ingredient inour construction is an input reduction lemma, which allows us to assume thatany polynomial source with min-entropy $k$ can be generated by $O(k)$ uniformlyrandom bits.We also provide strong formal evidence that polynomial sources are unusuallychallenging to extract from, by showing that even our most powerful generalpurpose extractors cannot handle polynomial sources with min-entropy below$k\geq n-o(n)$. In more detail, we show that sumset extractors cannot evendisperse from degree $2$ polynomial sources with min-entropy $k\geqn-O(n/\log\log n)$. In fact, this impossibility result even holds for a morespecialized family of sources that we introduce, called polynomialnon-oblivious bit-fixing (NOBF) sources. Polynomial NOBF sources are a naturalnew family of algebraic sources that lie at the intersection of polynomial andvariety sources, and thus our impossibility result applies to both of theseclassical settings. This is especially surprising, since we do have varietyextractors that slightly beat this barrier - implying that sumset extractorsare not a panacea in the world of seedless extraction.","['Cornell University', 'mgurumuk@cs.cornell.edu', 'jpmgoodman@cs.cornell.edu']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11019

An ideal characterizationshould distinguish different functional regions with robustness to noise andidiosyncrasies of individual brains that do not correspond to computationaldifferences. Previous studies have characterized brain representations by theirrepresentational geometry, which is defined by the representationaldissimilarity matrix (RDM), a summary statistic that abstracts from the rolesof individual neurons (or responses channels) and characterizes thediscriminability of stimuli. Here we explore a further step of abstraction:from the geometry to the topology of brain representations. We proposetopological representational similarity analysis (tRSA), an extension ofrepresentational similarity analysis (RSA) that uses a family ofgeo-topological summary statistics that generalizes the RDM to characterize thetopology while de-emphasizing the geometry. We evaluate this new family ofstatistics in terms of the sensitivity and specificity for model selectionusing both simulations and functional MRI (fMRI) data.

We address these challenges based on two keyinsights: (1) Inside the $k$-hop neighborhood, a significant fraction of thenodes is not impacted by the modified edges when the model uses min or max asaggregation function; (2) When the model weights remain static while the graphstructure changes, node embeddings can incrementally evolve over time bycomputing only the impacted part of the neighborhood.

The challenge of S-CBVR task ishow to achieve high temporal alignment accuracy with efficient computation andlow storage consumption. In this paper, we propose a Segment Similarity andAlignment Network (SSAN) in dealing with the challenge which is firstly trainedend-to-end in S-CBVR. SSAN is based on two newly proposed modules in videoretrieval: (1) An efficient Self-supervised Keyframe Extraction (SKE) module toreduce redundant frame features, (2) A robust Similarity Pattern Detection(SPD) module for temporal alignment. In comparison with uniform frameextraction, SKE not only saves feature storage and search time, but alsointroduces comparable accuracy and limited extra computation time. In terms oftemporal alignment, SPD localizes similar segments with higher accuracy andefficiency than existing deep learning methods. Furthermore, we jointly trainSSAN with SKE and SPD and achieve an end-to-end improvement. Meanwhile, the twokey modules SKE and SPD can also be effectively inserted into other videoretrieval pipelines and gain considerable performance improvements.Experimental results on public datasets show that SSAN can obtain higheralignment accuracy while saving storage and online query computational costcompared to existing methods.","['permissions@acm.org', 'chengyuan.c@antgroup.com', 'wq@antgroup.com', 'yl@antgroup.com', 'pantan.pt@antgroup.com', 'ODU', 'UC', 'sifeng.hsf@antgroup.com', 'ayou.zxb@antgroup.com', 'kaiming.huangkm@antgroup.com', 'booyoungxu.xfr@antgroup.com', 'weichu.cw@antgroup.com', 'PTS', 'ivy.zw@antgroup.com', 'USA', 'qichen.jc@antgroup.com', 'jiegang.yxd@antgroup.com']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11091

Previous Vision Transformer (ViT)-based detectors havedemonstrated subpar performance in cross-database evaluations, primarilybecause fully fine-tuning with limited Deepfake data often leads to forgettingpre-trained knowledge and over-fitting to data-specific ones. To circumventthese issues, we propose a novel Forgery-aware Adaptive Vision Transformer(FA-ViT). In FA-ViT, the vanilla ViT's parameters are frozen to preserve itspre-trained knowledge, while two specially designed components, the Local-awareForgery Injector (LFI) and the Global-aware Forgery Adaptor (GFA), are employedto adapt forgery-related knowledge. our proposed FA-ViT effectively combinesthese two different types of knowledge to form the general forgery features fordetecting Deepfakes. Specifically, LFI captures local discriminativeinformation and incorporates these information into ViT viaNeighborhood-Preserving Cross Attention (NPCA). Simultaneously, GFA learnsadaptive knowledge in the self-attention layer, bridging the gap between thetwo different domain. Furthermore, we design a novel Single Domain PairwiseLearning (SDPL) to facilitate fine-grained information learning in FA-ViT.

A keyquestion in PFL is to decide which parameters of a client should be localizedor shared with others. In current mainstream approaches, all layers that aresensitive to non-IID data (such as classifier layers) are generallypersonalized. The reasoning behind this approach is understandable, aslocalizing parameters that are easily influenced by non-IID data can preventthe potential negative effect of collaboration. However, we believe that thisapproach is too conservative for collaboration. For example, for a certainclient, even if its parameters are easily influenced by non-IID data, it canstill benefit by sharing these parameters with clients having similar datadistribution. This observation emphasizes the importance of considering notonly the sensitivity to non-IID data but also the similarity of datadistribution when determining which parameters should be localized in PFL. Thispaper introduces a novel guideline for client collaboration in PFL. Unlikeexisting approaches that prohibit all collaboration of sensitive parameters,our guideline allows clients to share more parameters with others, leading toimproved model performance. Additionally, we propose a new PFL method namedFedCAC, which employs a quantitative metric to evaluate each parameter'ssensitivity to non-IID data and carefully selects collaborators based on thisevaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that FedCAC enables clients toshare more parameters with others, resulting in superior performance comparedto state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios where clients havediverse distributions.","['University of Texas', ' State', 'USA', 'University of Texas at Dallas', 'State', 'shaojie.tang@utdallas.edu']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11103

Inparticular, recursive feasibility is guaranteed by making the safe-setconstraint move backward over the horizon, and assuming that such set satisfiesa condition that is weaker than control invariance. Safety is insteadguaranteed under an even weaker assumption on the safe set, triggering a safetask-abortion strategy whenever a risk of constraint violation is detected.

In GNSS-FGO, we fuse asynchronous sensormeasurements into the graph with a continuous-time trajectory representationusing Gaussian process regression. This enables querying states at arbitrarytimestamps so that sensor observations are fused without requiring strict stateand measurement synchronization. Thus, the proposed method presents ageneralized factor graph for multi-sensor fusion.

These approaches overlook the true functionalityof the decoder: receiving low-resolution feature maps from the encoder andrestoring feature map resolution and lost information through upsampling. As aresult, the decoder, especially its upsampling component, plays a crucial rolein enhancing segmentation outcomes. However, in 3D medical image segmentation,the commonly used transposed convolution can result in visual artifacts. Thisissue stems from the absence of direct relationship between adjacent pixels inthe output feature map. Furthermore, plain encoder has already possessedsufficient feature extraction capability because downsampling operation leadsto the gradual expansion of the receptive field, but the loss of informationduring downsampling process is unignorable.

Owing to the noisy nature of the channel, it may beoverly restrictive to attempt to detect all deviations. In our formulation, weonly require detecting deviations which impede the decoding of thenon-deviating user's message. When neither user deviates, correct decoding isrequired. When one user deviates, the decoder must either output a pair ofmessages of which the message of the non-deviating user is correct or identifythe deviating user. The users and the receiver do not share any randomness. Theresults include a characterization of the set of channels where communicationis feasible, and an inner and outer bound on the capacity region.

This can lead to non-uniformrepresentation distribution, which is a crucial factor for the performance ofcontrastive learning methods.

However, it has two limitations. First, itdoes not quantify the deviation of instance-level (local) effects from theaverage (global) effect, known as heterogeneity. Second, for estimating theaverage effect, it partitions the feature domain into user-defined, fixed-sizedbins, where different bin sizes may lead to inconsistent ALE estimations. Toaddress these limitations, we propose Robust and Heterogeneity-aware ALE(RHALE). RHALE quantifies the heterogeneity by considering the standarddeviation of the local effects and automatically determines an optimalvariable-size bin-splitting. In this paper, we prove that to achieve anunbiased approximation of the standard deviation of local effects within eachbin, bin splitting must follow a set of sufficient conditions. Based on theseconditions, we propose an algorithm that automatically determines the optimalpartitioning, balancing the estimation bias and variance.

Thisis especially true for proof-of-stake blockchain protocols in which the nextminer or set of miners have to be chosen randomly and each party's likelihoodto be selected is in proportion to their stake in the cryptocurrency.Current random beacons used in proof-of-stake protocols, such as Ouroborosand Algorand, have two fundamental limitations: Either (i)~they rely onpseudorandomness, e.g.~assuming that the output of a hash function is uniform,which is a widely-used but unproven assumption, or (ii)~they generate theirrandomness using a distributed protocol in which several participants arerequired to submit random numbers which are then used in the generation of afinal random result. However, in this case, there is no guarantee that thenumbers provided by the parties are uniformly random and there is no incentivefor the parties to honestly generate uniform randomness. Most random beaconshave both limitations.In this thesis, we provide a protocol for distributed generation ofrandomness. Our protocol does not rely on pseudorandomness at all. Similar tosome of the previous approaches, it uses random inputs by differentparticipants to generate a final random result. However, the crucial differenceis that we provide a game-theoretic guarantee showing that it is in everyone'sbest interest to submit uniform random numbers. Hence, our approach is thefirst to incentivize honest behavior instead of just assuming it. Moreover, theapproach is trustless and generates unbiased random numbers. It is alsotamper-proof and no party can change the output or affect its distribution.Finally, it is designed with modularity in mind and can be easily plugged intoexisting distributed protocols such as proof-of-stake blockchains.",[],2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.1125

Finally, the simulation of the Brokenshiretorsion experiment is carried out by using the matrix-based scheme, and thesimilarity in the shapes of the experimental and numerical broken specimensfurther demonstrates the ability of the proposed approach to deal with 3Dnon-planar fracture problems.

Thequality of the input data and the model highly influence the successfulend-to-end testing in data-sensitive systems. However, the testing approachesof input data are not as systematic and are few compared to model testing. Toaddress this gap, this paper presents the Fault Injection for UndesirableLearning in input Data (FIUL-Data) testing framework that tests the resilienceof ML models to multiple intentionally-triggered data faults. Data mutatorsexplore vulnerabilities of ML systems against the effects of different faultinjections. The proposed framework is designed based on three main ideas: Themutators are not random; one data mutator is applied at an instance of time,and the selected ML models are optimized beforehand. This paper evaluates theFIUL-Data framework using data from analytical chemistry, comprising retentiontime measurements of anti-sense oligonucleotide. Empirical evaluation iscarried out in a two-step process in which the responses of selected ML modelsto data mutation are analyzed individually and then compared with each other.The results show that the FIUL-Data framework allows the evaluation of theresilience of ML models. In most experiments cases, ML models show higherresilience at larger training datasets, where gradient boost performed betterthan support vector regression in smaller training sets. Overall, the meansquared error metric is useful in evaluating the resilience of models due toits higher sensitivity to data mutation.","['IU', 'UL', 'FIU', 'manal.rahal@kau.se', 'jorgen.samuelsson@kau.se', 'bestoun@kau.se']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11274

In this paper, we propose a real-timecross-platform neural video codec, which is capable of efficiently decoding of720P video bitstream from other encoding platforms on a consumer-grade GPU.First, to solve the problem of inconsistency of codec caused by the uncertaintyof floating point calculations across platforms, we design a calibrationtransmitting system to guarantee the consistent quantization of entropyparameters between the encoding and decoding stages. The parameters that mayhave transboundary quantization between encoding and decoding are identified inthe encoding stage, and their coordinates will be delivered by auxiliarytransmitted bitstream. By doing so, these inconsistent parameters can beprocessed properly in the decoding stage. Furthermore, to reduce the bitrate ofthe auxiliary bitstream, we rectify the distribution of entropy parametersusing a piecewise Gaussian constraint. Second, to match the computationallimitations on the decoding side for real-time video codec, we design alightweight model. A series of efficiency techniques enable our model toachieve 25 FPS decoding speed on NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that our model can achieve real-time decoding of 720P videos whileencoding on another platform.

In this paper, we address this need byproposing a method to measure the \textit{representation capacity} ofembeddings.

By combining extrinsic evaluationmethods, such as classification and clustering, with t-SNE-based neighborhoodanalysis, such as neighborhood agreement and trustworthiness, we provide acomprehensive assessment of the representation capacity. Additionally, the useof optimization techniques (bayesian optimization) for weight optimization (forclassification, clustering, neighborhood agreement, and trustworthiness)ensures an objective and data-driven approach in selecting the optimalcombination of metrics. The proposed method not only contributes to advancingthe field of embedding evaluation but also empowers researchers andpractitioners with a quantitative measure to assess the effectiveness ofembeddings in capturing structural and contextual information.

In this thesis, we consider interprocedural data-flowanalysis as formalized by the standard IFDS framework, which can express manywidely-used static analyses such as reaching definitions, live variables, andnull-pointer. We focus on the well-studied on-demand setting in which queriesarrive one-by-one in a stream and each query should be answered as fast aspossible. While the classical IFDS algorithm provides a polynomial-timesolution to this problem, it is not scalable in practice. Specifically, iteither requires a quadratic-time preprocessing phase or takes linear time perquery, both of which are untenable for modern huge codebases with hundreds ofthousands of lines. Previous works have already shown that parameterizing theproblem by the treewidth of the program's control-flow graph is promising andcan lead to significant gains in efficiency. Unfortunately, these results wereonly applicable to the limited special case of same-context queries.In this work, we obtain significant speedups for the general case ofon-demand IFDS with queries that are not necessarily same-context. This isachieved by exploiting a new graph sparsity parameter, namely the treedepth ofthe program's call graph. Our approach is the first to exploit the sparsity ofcontrol-flow graphs and call graphs at the same time and parameterize by bothtreewidth and treedepth.

Thecontract's execution is then performed on-chain and is subject to consensus,i.e. every node on the blockchain network has to run the function calls andkeep track of their side-effects. In most programmable blockchains, such asEthereum, the notion of gas is introduced to prevent DoS attacks by maliciousparties who might try to slow down the network by performing heavycomputations. A fixed cost to each atomic operation, and the initiator of afunction call pays the total gas cost as a transaction fee. This helps preventDoS attacks, but the resulting fees are extremely high. For example, in 2022,on Ethereum alone, there has been a total gas usage of 1.77 Million ETH ~ 4.3Billion USD. This thesis proposes ""lazy contracts"" as a solution to alleviatethese costs. Our solution moves most of the computation off-chain, ensuringthat each function call incurs only a tiny amount of gas usage, whilepreserving enough data on-chain to guarantee an implicit consensus about thestate of the contract variables and ownership of funds. A complete on-chainexecution of the functions will only be triggered in case two parties to thecontract are in disagreement about the current state, which in turn can onlyhappen if at least one party is dishonest. In such cases, our protocol canidentify the dishonest party and penalize them by having them pay for theentire gas usage. Hence, no rational party has an incentive to act dishonestly.Finally, we perform extensive experiments over 160,735 real-world Soliditycontracts that were involved in 9,055,492 transactions in January 2022--January2023 on Ethereum and show that our approach reduces the overall gas usage by55.4%, which amounts to an astounding saving of 109.9 Million USD in gas fees.",[],2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11317

Despite being an active field of research, Zhang's method remainswidely used for camera calibration due to its implementation in populartoolboxes. However, this method initially assumes a pinhole model withoversimplified distortion models. In this work, we propose a novel approachthat involves a pre-processing step to remove distortions from images by meansof Gaussian processes. Our method does not need to assume any distortion modeland can be applied to severely warped images, even in the case of multipledistortion sources, e.g., a fisheye image of a curved mirror reflection. TheGaussian processes capture all distortions and camera imperfections, resultingin virtual images as though taken by an ideal pinhole camera with squarepixels. Furthermore, this ideal GP-camera only needs one image of a square gridcalibration pattern. This model allows for a serious upgrade of many algorithmsand applications that are designed in a pure projective geometry setting butwith a performance that is very sensitive to nonlinear lens distortions. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our method by simplifying Zhang's calibrationmethod, reducing the number of parameters and getting rid of the distortionparameters and iterative optimization. We validate by means of synthetic dataand real world images. The contributions of this work include the constructionof a virtual ideal pinhole camera using Gaussian processes, a simplifiedcalibration method and lens distortion removal.","['Penn', 'ivan.deboi@uantwerpen.be']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11326

They also offer sizableimprovements in terms of predictive performance over single models. However,deep ensembles are not commonly used in environments with limited computationalbudget -- such as autonomous driving -- since the complexity grows linearlywith the number of ensemble members. An important observation that can be madefor robotics applications, such as autonomous driving, is that data istypically sequential. For instance, when an object is to be recognized, anautonomous vehicle typically observes a sequence of images, rather than asingle image. This raises the question, could the deep ensemble be spread overtime?In this work, we propose and analyze Deep Ensembles Spread Over Time (DESOT).The idea is to apply only a single ensemble member to each data point in thesequence, and fuse the predictions over a sequence of data points. We implementand experiment with DESOT for traffic sign classification, where sequences oftracked image patches are to be classified. We find that DESOT obtains thebenefits of deep ensembles, in terms of predictive and uncertainty estimationperformance, while avoiding the added computational cost.

For such asystem, read/write registers are called anonymous registers. It is known thatsymmetric deadlock-free mutual exclusion is solvable for any finite number ofprocesses using anonymous registers [1]. The main question left open in [14,15]is the existence of starvation-free mutual exclusion algorithms for two or moreprocesses. We resolve this open question for memoryless algorithms, in which aprocess that tries to enter its critical section does not use any informationabout its previous attempts. Almost all known mutual exclusion algorithms arememoryless. We show that (1) there is a symmetric memoryless starvation-freemutual exclusion algorithm for two processes using $m \geq 7$ anonymousregisters if and only if $m$ is odd; and (2) there is no symmetric memorylessstarvation-free mutual exclusion algorithm for $n\geq 3$ processes using (anynumber of) anonymous registers. Our impossibility result is the only example ofa system with fault-free processes, where global progress (i.e.,deadlock-freedom) can be ensured, while individual progress to each process(i.e., starvation-freedom) cannot.

However, these methodstypically create simulation environments and rewards for specific tasks,resulting in the requirements of multiple policies and limited capabilities fortackling complex and unknown tasks. To overcome these issues, we present anovel approach that combines adversarial imitation learning with large languagemodels (LLMs). This innovative method enables the agent to learn reusableskills with a single policy and solve zero-shot tasks under the guidance ofLLMs. In particular, we utilize the LLM as a strategic planner for applyingpreviously learned skills to novel tasks through the comprehension oftask-specific prompts. This empowers the robot to perform the specified actionsin a sequence. To improve our model, we incorporate codebook-based vectorquantization, allowing the agent to generate suitable actions in response tounseen textual commands from LLMs. Furthermore, we design general rewardfunctions that consider the distinct motion features of humanoid robots,ensuring the agent imitates the motion data while maintaining goal orientationwithout additional guiding direction approaches or policies.

The interaction graph of an automatanetwork is its most important parameter, as it represents the overallarchitecture of the network. A continuous amount of work has been devoted toinfer dynamical properties of the automata network based on its interactiongraph only. Robert's theorem is the seminal result in this area; it states thatautomata networks with an acyclic interaction graph converge to a unique fixedpoint. The feedback bound can be viewed as an extension of Robert's theorem; itgives an upper bound on the number of fixed points of an automata network basedon the size of a minimum feedback vertex set of its interaction graph. Booleannetworks can be viewed as self-mappings on the power set lattice of the set ofentities. In this paper, we consider self-mappings on a general completelattice. We make two conceptual contributions. Firstly, we can view a digraphas a residuated mapping on the power set lattice; as such, we define a graph ona complete lattice as a residuated mapping on that lattice. We extend andgeneralise some results on digraphs to our setting. Secondly, we introduce ageneralised notion of dependency whereby any mapping $\phi$ can depend on anyother mapping $\alpha$. In fact, we are able to give four kinds of dependencyin this case. We can then vastly expand Robert's theorem to self-mappings ongeneral complete lattices; we similarly generalise the feedback bound. We thenobtain stronger results in the case where the lattice is a complete Booleanalgebra.

In this paper, we introduce a generalization of this powerfulalgorithmic primitive that is phrased in terms of $k$-secluded vertex sets:sets with an open neighborhood of size at most $k$.In this terminology, the bound on important separators says that there are atmost $4^k$ maximal $k$-secluded connected vertex sets $C$ containing $S$ butdisjoint from $T$. We generalize this statement significantly: even when wedemand that $G[C]$ avoids a finite set $\mathcal{F}$ of forbidden inducedsubgraphs, the number of such maximal subgraphs is $2^{O(k)}$ and they can beenumerated efficiently. This allows us to make significant improvements for twoproblems from the literature.Our first application concerns the 'Connected $k$-Secluded $\mathcal{F}$-freesubgraph' problem, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite set of forbidden inducedsubgraphs. Given a graph in which each vertex has a positive integer weight,the problem asks to find a maximum-weight connected $k$-secluded vertex set $C\subseteq V(G)$ such that $G[C]$ does not contain an induced subgraphisomorphic to any $F \in \mathcal{F}$. The parameterization by $k$ is known tobe solvable in triple-exponential time via the technique of recursiveunderstanding, which we improve to single-exponential.Our second application concerns the deletion problem to scattered graphclasses. Here, the task is to find a vertex set of size at most $k$ whoseremoval yields a graph whose each connected component belongs to one of theprescribed graph classes $\Pi_1, \ldots, \Pi_d$. We obtain a single-exponentialalgorithm whenever each class $\Pi_i$ is characterized by a finite number offorbidden induced subgraphs.

For example, previous work has shownthat patient self-reported race can be predicted from medical data that doesnot explicitly contain racial information. However, the extent of dataidentification is unknown, and we lack ways to develop models whose outcomesare minimally affected by such information. Here we systematically investigatedthe ability of time-series electronic health record data to predict patientstatic information. We found that not only the raw time-series data, but alsolearned representations from machine learning models, can be trained to predicta variety of static information with area under the receiver operatingcharacteristic curve as high as 0.851 for biological sex, 0.869 for binarizedage and 0.810 for self-reported race. Such high predictive performance can beextended to a wide range of comorbidity factors and exists even when the modelwas trained for different tasks, using different cohorts, using different modelarchitectures and databases. Given the privacy and fairness concerns thesefindings pose, we develop a variational autoencoder-based approach that learnsa structured latent space to disentangle patient-sensitive attributes fromtime-series data.

We base our experiments on questions and passagesfrom the MS MARCO (V1) test collection, and a retrieval pipeline consisting ofsparse retrieval, dense retrieval and neural rerankers. In the firstexperiment, we validate the generated answer in its entirety. After presentinga question to an LLM and receiving a generated answer, we query the corpus withthe combination of the question + generated answer. We then present the LLMwith the combination of the question + generated answer + retrieved answer,prompting it to indicate if the generated answer can be supported by theretrieved answer.

We querythe corpus with each factual statement and then present the LLM with thestatement and the corresponding retrieved evidence. The LLM is prompted toindicate if the statement can be supported and make necessary edits using theretrieved material. With an accuracy of over 80%, we find that an LLM iscapable of verifying its generated answer when a corpus of supporting materialis provided.

Most segmentation approaches in the literature representthe body's trajectory as a point trajectory, considering only its translationand neglecting its rotation. We propose a novel trajectory representation forrigid-body motions that incorporates both translation and rotation, andadditionally exhibits several invariant properties. This representationconsists of a geometric progress rate and a third-order trajectory-shapedescriptor. Concepts from screw theory were used to make this representationtime-invariant and also invariant to the choice of body reference point. Thisnew representation is validated for a self-supervised segmentation approach,both in simulation and using real recordings of human-demonstrated pouringmotions. The results show a more robust detection of consecutive submotionswith distinct features and a more consistent segmentation compared toconventional representations.

For this reason, deep learning methodscapable of learning directly from the compressed domain have been gainingattention in recent years.

A basic requirement for digital twins of nonlinear dynamicalsystems is the ability to generate the system evolution and predict potentiallycatastrophic emergent behaviors so as to providing early warnings. The digitaltwin can then be used for system ""health"" monitoring in real time and forpredictive problem solving. In particular, if the digital twin forecasts apossible system collapse in the future due to parameter drifting as caused byenvironmental changes or perturbations, an optimal control strategy can bedevised and executed as early intervention to prevent the collapse. Twoapproaches exist for constructing digital twins of nonlinear dynamical systems:sparse optimization and machine learning.

Nevertheless, it still has a high computational costand demands a significant amount of parameters. Such requirements hinder theuse in resource-limited environments and demand both software and hardwareoptimization. Another limitation is that deep models are usually specializedinto a single domain or task, requiring them to learn and store new parametersfor each new one. Multi-Domain Learning (MDL) attempts to solve this problem bylearning a single model that is capable of performing well in multiple domains.Nevertheless, the models are usually larger than the baseline for a singledomain. This work tackles both of these problems: our objective is to prunemodels capable of handling multiple domains according to a user-defined budget,making them more computationally affordable while keeping a similarclassification performance. We achieve this by encouraging all domains to use asimilar subset of filters from the baseline model, up to the amount defined bythe user's budget. Then, filters that are not used by any domain are prunedfrom the network. The proposed approach innovates by better adapting toresource-limited devices while, to our knowledge, being the only work thathandles multiple domains at test time with fewer parameters and lowercomputational complexity than the baseline model for a single domain.","['GU', 'ODU', 'UC', 'berriel@lcad.inf.ufes.br', 'lipe.samuel@unifesp.br', 'niculae.sebe@unitn.it', 'SC', 'AU', 'UNI', 'jurandy.almeida@ufscar.br', 'UF', 'OU', 'todsantos@inf.ufes.br']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11464

Recall that a distance labeling is a distributed representation ofdistances in a metric space $(X,d)$, where each point $x\in X$ is assigned asuccinct label, such that the distance between any two points $x,y \in X$ canbe approximated given only their labels. A highly structured special case is anembedding into $\ell_\infty$, where each point $x\in X$ is assigned a vector$f(x)$ such that $\|f(x)-f(y)\|_\infty$ is approximately $d(x,y)$. Theperformance of a distance labeling or an $\ell_\infty$-embedding is measuredvia its distortion and its label-size/dimension.We also study the analogous question for the prioritized versions of thesetwo measures. Here, a priority order $\pi=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ of the point set $X$is given, and higher-priority points should have shorter labels. Formally, adistance labeling has prioritized label-size $\alpha(\cdot)$ if every $x_j$ haslabel size at most $\alpha(j)$. Similarly, an embedding $f: X \to \ell_\infty$has prioritized dimension $\alpha(\cdot)$ if $f(x_j)$ is non-zero only in thefirst $\alpha(j)$ coordinates. In addition, we compare these prioritizedmeasures to their classical (worst-case) versions.We answer these questions in several scenarios, uncovering a surprisinglydiverse range of behaviors. First, in some cases labelings and embeddings havevery similar worst-case performance, but in other cases there is a hugedisparity. However in the prioritized setting, we most often find a strictseparation between the performance of labelings and embeddings.

(2022). Thesetting is the following: we (the platform) offer a menu of suppliers to eachcustomer. Then, every customer selects, simultaneously and independently, tomatch with a supplier or to remain unmatched. Each supplier observes the subsetof customers that selected them, and choose either to match a customer or toleave the system. Therefore, a match takes place if both a customer and asupplier sequentially select each other. Each agent's behavior is probabilisticand determined by a discrete choice model. Our goal is to choose an assortmentfamily that maximizes the expected revenue of the matching. Given the hardnessof the problem, we show a $1-1/e$-approximation factor for the heterogeneoussetting where customers follow general choice models and suppliers follow ageneral choice model whose demand function is monotone and submodular. Ourapproach is flexible enough to allow for different assortment constraints andfor a revenue objective function. Furthermore, we design an algorithm thatbeats the $1-1/e$ barrier and, in fact, is asymptotically optimal whensuppliers follow the classic multinomial-logit choice model and aresufficiently selective. We finally provide other results and further insights.Notably, in the unconstrained setting where customers and suppliers followmultinomial-logit models, we design a simple and efficient approximationalgorithm that appropriately randomizes over a family of nested-assortments.Also, we analyze various aspects of the matching market model that lead toseveral operational insights, such as the fact that matching platforms canbenefit from allowing the more selective agents to initiate the matchmakingprocess.","['Cornell University', 'lodi@cornell.edu', 'GT', 'alfredo.torrico@cornell.edu']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04313

More specifically, by analyzing the structure ofminimum-weight codewords of polar codes (as special sums of the rows in thepolar transform matrix), we can identify rows (corresponding to\textit{information} bits) that contribute the most to the formation of suchcodewords and then replace them with other rows (corresponding to\textit{frozen} bits) that bring in few minimum-weight codewords.

However, these methods oftenoverlook the important multimodal property of the optimal paths in the trainingset, making them incapable of finding good paths in some scenarios.

Experimental specimens in the life sciences are subjectto individual variability and deformation, and therefore require autonomousrobotic control. As an example, we are studying the installation of a cranialwindow in a mouse. This operation requires the removal of the skull, which isapproximately 300 um thick, to cut it into a circular shape 8 mm in diameter,but the shape of the mouse skull varies depending on the strain of mouse, sexand week of age. The thickness of the skull is not uniform, with some areasbeing thin and others thicker. It is also difficult to ensure that the skullsof the mice are kept in the same position for each operation. It is notrealistically possible to measure all these features and pre-program a robotictrajectory for individual mice. The paper therefore proposes an autonomousrobotic drilling method. The proposed method consists of drilling trajectoryplanning and image-based task completion level recognition. The trajectoryplanning adjusts the z-position of the drill according to the task completionlevel at each discrete point, and forms the 3D drilling path via constrainedcubic spline interpolation while avoiding overshoot. The task completion levelrecognition uses a DSSD-inspired deep learning model to estimate the taskcompletion level of each discrete point. Since an egg has similarcharacteristics to a mouse skull in terms of shape, thickness and mechanicalproperties, removing the egg shell without damaging the membrane underneath waschosen as the simulation task. The proposed method was evaluated using a 6-DOFrobotic arm holding a drill and achieved a success rate of 80% out of 20trials.","['ODU', 'UC']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12265

This paper targets onhandling a class of generic composite optimization problems over multi-agentcyberphysical systems (CPSs), with the existence of an unknown number ofByzantine agents. Based on the proximal mapping method, two variance-reduced(VR) techniques, and a norm-penalized approximation strategy, we propose adecentralized Byzantine-resilient and proximal-gradient algorithmic framework,dubbed Prox-DBRO-VR, which achieves an optimization and control goal using onlylocal computations and communications. To reduce asymptotically the variancegenerated by evaluating the noisy stochastic gradients, we incorporate twolocalized variance-reduced techniques (SAGA and LSVRG) into Prox-DBRO-VR, todesign Prox-DBRO-SAGA and Prox-DBRO-LSVRG. Via analyzing the contractionrelationships among the gradient-learning error, robust consensus condition,and optimal gap, the theoretical result demonstrates that both Prox-DBRO-SAGAand Prox-DBRO-LSVRG, with a well-designed constant (resp., decaying) step-size,converge linearly (resp., sub-linearly) inside an error ball around the optimalsolution to the optimization problem under standard assumptions. The trade-offsbetween the convergence accuracy and the number of Byzantine agents in bothlinear and sub-linear cases are characterized. In simulation, the effectivenessand practicability of the proposed algorithms are manifested via resolving asparse machine-learning problem over multi-agent CPSs under various Byzantineattacks.","['jinhuihu@csu.edu.cn', 'ODU', 'huaqingli@swu.edu.cn', 'UC', 'jinhuihu-c@my.cityu.edu.hk', 'guochen@ieee.org', 'OC', 'Central']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08051

It usually consists of two stages: patch-level feature extraction andslide-level aggregation. Recently, pretrained models or self-supervisedlearning have been used to extract patch features, but they suffer from loweffectiveness or inefficiency due to overlooking the task-specific supervisionprovided by slide labels. Here we propose a weakly-supervised Label-EfficientWSI Screening method, dubbed LESS, for cytological WSI analysis with onlyslide-level labels, which can be effectively applied to small datasets. First,we suggest using variational positive-unlabeled (VPU) learning to uncoverhidden labels of both benign and malignant patches. We provide appropriatesupervision by using slide-level labels to improve the learning of patch-levelfeatures. Next, we take into account the sparse and random arrangement of cellsin cytological WSIs. To address this, we propose a strategy to crop patches atmultiple scales and utilize a cross-attention vision transformer (CrossViT) tocombine information from different scales for WSI classification. Thecombination of our two steps achieves task-alignment, improving effectivenessand efficiency.

Still, there are many problems in differential privacy for which wedon't know suitable lower bounds, and even for problems that we do, the lowerbounds are not smooth, and usually become vacuous when the error is larger thansome threshold.In this work, we present a simple method to generate hard instances byapplying a padding-and-permuting transformation to a fingerprinting code. Weillustrate the applicability of this method by providing new lower bounds invarious settings:1. A tight lower bound for DP averaging in the low-accuracy regime, which inparticular implies a new lower bound for the private 1-cluster problemintroduced by Nissim, Stemmer, and Vadhan (PODS 2016).2. A lower bound on the additive error of DP algorithms for approximatek-means clustering, as a function of the multiplicative error, which is tightfor a constant multiplication error.3. A lower bound for estimating the top singular vector of a matrix under DPin low-accuracy regimes, which is a special case of DP subspace estimationstudied by Singhal and Steinke (NeurIPS 2021).Our main technique is to apply a padding-and-permuting transformation to afingerprinting code.

In thispaper, we take the first step towards exploring the ability of LLMs tounderstand emotional stimuli.

Our tasks span deterministic and generativeapplications that represent comprehensive evaluation scenarios. Our automaticexperiments show that LLMs have a grasp of emotional intelligence, and theirperformance can be improved with emotional prompts (which we call""EmotionPrompt"" that combines the original prompt with emotional stimuli),e.g., 8.00% relative performance improvement in Instruction Induction and 115%in BIG-Bench. In addition to those deterministic tasks that can beautomatically evaluated using existing metrics, we conducted a human study with106 participants to assess the quality of generative tasks using both vanillaand emotional prompts. Our human study results demonstrate that EmotionPromptsignificantly boosts the performance of generative tasks (10.9% averageimprovement in terms of performance, truthfulness, and responsibility metrics).We provide an in-depth discussion regarding why EmotionPrompt works for LLMsand the factors that may influence its performance.

Specifically, we decompose this frameworkto motion prediction and motion-conditioned rendering: (1) We first design ananimation prediction module that efficiently obtains smooth and lip-sync motionsequences conditioned on the driven speech. This module adopts anon-autoregressive network to obtain context prior and improve the predictionefficiency, and it learns a speech-animation mapping prior with bettergeneralization to novel speech from a multi-identity video dataset.

Rather than modelling uncertainty in high-dimensional statetransition distributions as model-based approaches do, we model uncertainty ina one-dimensional Bellman operator.

This mappingincludes interactions of all possible orders, going beyond the conventionalpairwise interactions typically considered in the inverse Ising approach, andallowing the description of complex datasets. Earlier works attempted toachieve this goal, but the proposed mappings did not do properly treat thecomplexity of the problem or did not contain direct prescriptions for practicalapplication. To validate our method, we performed several controlled numericalexperiments where we trained the RBMs using equilibrium samples of predefinedmodels containing local external fields, two-body and three-body interactionsin various low-dimensional topologies. The results demonstrate theeffectiveness of our proposed approach in learning the correct interactionnetwork and pave the way for its application in modeling interesting datasets.We also evaluate the quality of the inferred model based on different trainingmethods.",['alfonn@ucm.es'],2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02292

Asparse portfolio is desirable over a full portfolio in terms of transactioncost reduction and avoiding illiquid assets. To enforce the sparsity of theportfolio, conventional studies have proposed formulations based on$\ell_p$-norm regularizations as a continuous surrogate of the $\ell_0$-normregularization. Although such formulations can be used to construct sparseportfolios, they are not easy to use in actual investments because parametertuning to specify the exact upper bound on the number of assets in theportfolio is delicate and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a newproblem formulation of sparse index tracking using an $\ell_0$-norm constraintthat enables easy control of the upper bound on the number of assets in theportfolio. In addition, our formulation allows the choice between portfoliosparsity and turnover sparsity constraints, which also reduces transactioncosts by limiting the number of assets that are updated at each rebalancing.Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm for solving this problem basedon a primal-dual splitting method. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness ofthe proposed method through experiments on the S\&P500 and NASDAQ100 indexdatasets.","['yamagata.e.ab@m.titech.ac.jp', 'LU', 'ND']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10152

Recently, pre-training-based methods have been developed to tacklethis challenge. Though promising, in this paper, we show that existing methodssuffer from the notorious negative transfer issue, where the model adapted fromthe pre-trained model results in worse performance compared to the modellearned from scratch in the task of interest (i.e., target task). To addressthis issue, we develop a method, denoted as ANT, for transferable sequentialrecommendation. ANT mitigates negative transfer by 1) incorporatingmulti-modality item information, including item texts, images and prices, toeffectively learn more transferable knowledge from related tasks (i.e.,auxiliary tasks); and 2) better capturing task-specific knowledge in the targettask using a re-learning-based adaptation strategy. We evaluate ANT againsteight state-of-the-art baseline methods on five target tasks. Our experimentalresults demonstrate that ANT does not suffer from the negative transfer issueon any of the target tasks.

As a results, it ispossible to discover generalist controllers that can handle a wide range ofmorphological variations sufficiently without the need of the informationregarding their morphologies or adaptation of their parameters. We perform anextensive experimental analysis on simulation that demonstrates the trade-offbetween specialist and generalist controllers. The results show thatgeneralists are able to control a range of morphological variations with a costof underperforming on a specific morphology relative to a specialist.

While many tensorcompression algorithms are available, many of them rely on strong dataassumptions regarding its order, sparsity, rank, and smoothness. In this work,we propose TENSORCODEC, a lossy compression algorithm for general tensors thatdo not necessarily adhere to strong input data assumptions. TENSORCODECincorporates three key ideas. The first idea is Neural Tensor-TrainDecomposition (NTTD) where we integrate a recurrent neural network intoTensor-Train Decomposition to enhance its expressive power and alleviate thelimitations imposed by the low-rank assumption. Another idea is to fold theinput tensor into a higher-order tensor to reduce the space required by NTTD.Finally, the mode indices of the input tensor are reordered to reveal patternsthat can be exploited by NTTD for improved approximation.

Most ofthe existing methods are limited to the composition recognition ofsingle-attribute-object, and can hardly distinguish the compositions withsimilar appearances. In this paper, a graph-based model is proposed that canflexibly recognize both single- and multi-attribute-object compositions. Themodel maps the visual features of images and the attribute-object categorylabels represented by word embedding vectors into a latent space. Then,according to the constraints of the attribute-object semantic association,distances are calculated between visual features and the corresponding labelsemantic features in the latent space. During the inference, the compositionthat is closest to the given image feature among all compositions is used asthe reasoning result.

To solve the latter, itis mostly assumed that ground truth can be determined. However, in general, thedata gathering processes in the different sources are imperfect and cannotprovide an accurate merging of values. Thus, in the absence of ways todetermine ground truth, it is important to at least quantify how far from beinginternally consistent a dataset is. Hence, we propose definitions of concordantdata and define a discordance metric as a way of measuring disagreement toimprove decision making based on trustworthiness.We define the discord measurement problem of numerical attributes in whichgiven a set of uncertain raw observations or aggregate results (such ascase/hospitalization/death data relevant to COVID-19) and information on thealignment of different conceptualizations of the same reality (e.g.,granularities or units), we wish to assess whether the different sources areconcordant, or if not, use the discordance metric to quantify how discordantthey are. We also define a set of algebraic operators to describe thealignments of different data sources with correctness guarantees, together withtwo alternative relational database implementations that reduce the problem tolinear or quadratic programming. These are evaluated against both COVID-19 andsynthetic data, and our experimental results show that discordance measurementcan be performed efficiently in realistic situations.",[],2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13302

However, the provided safety assurances areoften predicated on the assumption that once deployed, the system or itsenvironment does not evolve. Online, however, an autonomous system mightexperience changes in system dynamics, control authority, externaldisturbances, and/or the surrounding environment, requiring updated safetyassurances. Rather than restarting the safety analysis from scratch, which canbe time-consuming and often intractable to perform online, we propose tocompute \textit{parameter-conditioned} reachable sets. Assuming expected systemand environment changes can be parameterized, we treat these parameters asvirtual states in the system and leverage recent advances in high-dimensionalreachability analysis to solve the corresponding reachability problem offline.This results in a family of reachable sets that is parameterized by theenvironment and system factors. Online, as these factors change, the system cansimply query the corresponding safety function from this family to ensuresystem safety, enabling a real-time update of the safety assurances.

By pre-processing the speech signal it is possible to improve thespeech intelligibility and quality -- this is known as near-end listeningenhancement (NLE). Although, existing NLE techniques are able to greatlyincrease intelligibility in harsh noise environments, in favorable noiseconditions the intelligibility of speech reaches a ceiling where it cannot befurther enhanced. Actually, the focus of existing methods solely on improvingthe intelligibility causes unnecessary processing of the speech signal andleads to speech distortions and quality degradations. In this paper, we providea new rationale for NLE, where the target speech is minimally processed interms of a processing penalty, provided that a certain performance constraint,e.g., intelligibility, is satisfied. We present a closed-form solution for thecase where the performance criterion is an intelligibility estimator based onthe approximated speech intelligibility index and the processing penalty is themean-square error between the processed and the clean speech. This produces anNLE method that adapts to changing noise conditions via a simple gain rule bylimiting the processing to the minimum necessary to achieve a desiredintelligibility, while at the same time focusing on quality in favorable noisesituations by minimizing the amount of speech distortions. Through simulationstudies, we show the proposed method attains speech quality on par or betterthan existing methods in both objective measurements and subjective listeningtests, whilst still sustaining objective speech intelligibility performance onpar with existing methods.","['GU', 'ODU', 'UC', 'UA', 'ND', 'AU', 'UD', 'OC']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17154

PoSE decouples train length from target context window size bysimulating long inputs using a fixed context window with manipulated positionindices during training. Concretely, we select several short chunks from a longinput sequence, and introduce distinct skipping bias terms to modify theposition indices of each chunk. These bias terms, along with the length of eachchunk, are altered for each training example, allowing the model to adapt toall positions within the target context window without training on full lengthinputs. Experiments show that, compared with fine-tuning on the full length,PoSE greatly reduces memory and time overhead with minimal impact onperformance. Leveraging this advantage, we have successfully extended the LLaMAmodel to 128k tokens. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that PoSE iscompatible with all RoPE-based LLMs and various position interpolationstrategies. Notably, by decoupling fine-tuning length from target contextwindow, PoSE can theoretically extend the context window infinitely,constrained only by memory usage for inference.

The double-scaled matrix integral has as itsleading density of states the universal Cardy density of primaries in atwo-dimensional CFT, thus motivating the name Virasoro minimal string. Theduality holds for any value of the continuous parameter $c$ and reduces to theJT gravity/matrix integral duality in the large central charge limit. It thusprovides a precise stringy realization of JT gravity. The main observables ofthe Virasoro minimal string are quantum analogues of the Weil-Peterssonvolumes, which are computed as absolutely convergent integrals of worldsheetCFT correlators over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.By exploiting a relation of the Virasoro minimal string to three-dimensionalgravity and intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, we areable to give a direct derivation of the duality.

However, there may not bea unique model representing that real-world phenomena. Two distinct modelscould yield the same exact dynamics. In this case, these models are calledindistinguishable. In this work, we consider the indistinguishability problemfor linear compartmental models, which are used in many areas, such aspharmacokinetics, physiology, cell biology, toxicology, and ecology. We exhibitsufficient conditions for indistinguishability for models with a certain graphstructure: paths from input to output with ""detours"". The benefit of applyingour results is that indistinguishability can be proven using only the graphstructure of the models, without the use of any symbolic computation. This canbe very helpful for medium-to-large sized linear compartmental models. Theseare the first sufficient conditions for indistinguishability of linearcompartmental models based on graph structure alone, as previously onlynecessary conditions for indistinguishability of linear compartmental modelsexisted based on graph structure alone. We prove our results by showing thatthe indistinguishable models are the same up to a renaming of parameters, whichwe call permutation indistinguishability.","['SU', 'GU', 'UIS', 'ND', 'UF', 'IC', 'OU']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10861

Focusing on data science applications with expensive objectivefunction evaluations yet inexpensive gradient function evaluations, gradientmethods that never make objective function evaluations are either beingrejuvenated or actively developed. However, as we show, such gradient methodsare all susceptible to catastrophic divergence under realistic conditions fordata science applications. In light of this, gradient methods which make use ofobjective function evaluations become more appealing, yet, as we show, canresult in an exponential increase in objective evaluations between acceptediterates. As a result, existing gradient methods are poorly suited to the needsof optimization problems arising from data science. In this work, we addressthis gap by developing a generic methodology that economically uses objectivefunction evaluations in a problem-driven manner to prevent catastrophicdivergence and avoid an explosion in objective evaluations between acceptediterates. Our methodology allows for specific procedures that can make use ofspecific step size selection methodologies or search direction strategies, andwe develop a novel step size selection methodology that is well-suited to datascience applications. We show that a procedure resulting from our methodologyis highly competitive with standard optimization methods on CUTEst testproblems.

To study this, we prove optimalcontraction rates for intrinsic Mat\'ern Gaussian processes defined on compactRiemannian manifolds. We also prove analogous rates for extrinsic processesusing trace and extension theorems between manifold and ambient Sobolev spaces:somewhat surprisingly, the rates obtained turn out to coincide with those ofthe intrinsic processes, provided that their smoothness parameters are matchedappropriately. We illustrate these rates empirically on a number of examples,which, mirroring prior work, show that intrinsic processes can achieve betterperformance in practice.

While MPPI can find a Gaussian-approximated optimal actiondistribution in closed form, i.e., without iterative solution updates, itstruggles with multimodality of the optimal distributions, such as thoseinvolving non-convex constraints for obstacle avoidance. This is due to theless representative nature of the Gaussian. To overcome this limitation, ourmethod aims to identify a target mode of the optimal distribution and guide thesolution to converge to fit it. In the proposed method, the target mode isroughly estimated using a modified Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)method and embedded into the MPPI algorithm to find a closed-form""mode-seeking"" solution that covers only the target mode, thus preserving thefast convergence property of MPPI.

The new iteration method is proved to converge unconditionally, andthe optimal iteration parameter is deducted. Naturally, this new iterationmethod leads to a diagonal and normal with circulant-block preconditioner whichcan be executed efficiently by fast algorithms. In theory, we provide sharpbounds for the eigenvalues of the discrete fractional Laplacian and itscirculant approximation, and further analysis indicates that the spectraldistribution of the preconditioned system matrix is tight. Numericalexperiments show that the new preconditioner can significantly improve thecomputational efficiency of the Krylov subspace iteration methods. Moreover,the corresponding preconditioned GMRES method shows space mesh size independentand almost fractional order parameter insensitive convergence behaviors.","['UA', 'zhangfy@nuaa.edu.cn', 'UAA', 'SC', 'NU', 'yangxi@nuaa.edu.cn', 'IIT', 'Brown']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11106

In our formulation, weonly require detecting deviations which impede the decoding of thenon-deviating user's message. When neither user deviates, correct decoding isrequired.

We prove that for $k\geq 3$, $k$-ACYCLIC COLOURABILITY isNP-complete for bipartite graphs of maximum degree $k+1$, thereby generalisingthe NP-completeness result of Ochem, and adding bipartiteness to theNP-completeness result of Mondal et al. In contrast, $k$-ACYCLIC COLOURABILITYis polynomial-time solvable for graphs of maximum degree at most $0.38\,k^{\,3/4}$. Hence, for $k\geq 3$, the least integer $d$ such that $k$-ACYCLICCOLOURABILITY in graphs of maximum degree $d$ is NP-complete, denoted by$L_a^{(k)}$, satisfies $0.38\, k^{\,3/4}<L_a^{(k)}\leq k+1$. We prove that for$k\geq 4$, $k$-ACYCLIC COLOURABILITY in $d$-regular graphs is NP-complete ifand only if $L_a^{(k)}\leq d\leq 2k-3$. We also show that it is coNP-hard tocheck whether an input graph $G$ admits a unique $k$-acyclic colouring up tocolour swaps (resp. up to colour swaps and automorphisms).",[],2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11212

For $k\in \mathbb{N}$, a $k$-colouring of a graph $G$ is a function$f\colon V(G)\to \mathbb{Z}_k$ such that $f(u)\neq f(v)$ for every edge $uv$ of$G$. A $k$-colouring of $G$ is called a $k$-star colouring of $G$ if there isno path $u,v,w,x$ in $G$ with $f(u)=f(w)$ and $f(v)=f(x)$. A $k$-colouring of$G$ is called a $k$-rs colouring of $G$ if there is no path $u,v,w$ in $G$ with$f(v)>f(u)=f(w)$. For $k\in \mathbb{N}$, the problem $k$-STAR COLOURABILITYtakes a graph $G$ as input and asks whether $G$ admits a $k$-star colouring.The problem $k$-RS COLOURABILITY is defined similarly. Recently, Brause et al.(Electron. J. Comb., 2022) investigated the complexity of 3-star colouring withrespect to the graph diameter. We study the complexity of $k$-star colouringand $k$-rs colouring with respect to the maximum degree for all $k\geq 3$. For$k\geq 3$, let us denote the least integer $d$ such that $k$-STAR COLOURABILITY(resp. $k$-RS COLOURABILITY) is NP-complete for graphs of maximum degree $d$ by$L_s^{(k)}$ (resp. $L_{rs}^{(k)}$).We prove that for $k=5$ and $k\geq 7$, $k$-STAR COLOURABILITY is NP-completefor graphs of maximum degree $k-1$. We also show that $4$-RS COLOURABILITY isNP-complete for planar 3-regular graphs of girth 5 and $k$-RS COLOURABILITY isNP-complete for triangle-free graphs of maximum degree $k-1$ for $k\geq 5$.Using these results, we prove the following: (i) for $k\geq 4$ and $d\leq k-1$,$k$-STAR COLOURABILITY is NP-complete for $d$-regular graphs if and only if$d\geq L_s^{(k)}$; and (ii) for $k\geq 4$, $k$-RS COLOURABILITY is NP-completefor $d$-regular graphs if and only if $L_{rs}^{(k)}\leq d\leq k-1$.","['shalu@iiitdm.ac.in', 'mar@smail.iitm.ac.in', 'IIT']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11221

An in-house software is developed in MATLAB.Firstly, the vibration of a cantilever beam is solved for validating the loop-and matrix-based schemes by comparing the numerical solutions to those producedby a FEM software. Subsequently, two typical dynamic crack propagation problemsare simulated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes insolving dynamic fracture problems. Finally, the simulation of the Brokenshiretorsion experiment is carried out by using the matrix-based scheme, and thesimilarity in the shapes of the experimental and numerical broken specimensfurther demonstrates the ability of the proposed approach to deal with 3Dnon-planar fracture problems.

The interaction graph of an automatanetwork is its most important parameter, as it represents the overallarchitecture of the network. A continuous amount of work has been devoted toinfer dynamical properties of the automata network based on its interactiongraph only. Robert's theorem is the seminal result in this area; it states thatautomata networks with an acyclic interaction graph converge to a unique fixedpoint. The feedback bound can be viewed as an extension of Robert's theorem; itgives an upper bound on the number of fixed points of an automata network basedon the size of a minimum feedback vertex set of its interaction graph. Booleannetworks can be viewed as self-mappings on the power set lattice of the set ofentities. In this paper, we consider self-mappings on a general completelattice. We make two conceptual contributions. Firstly, we can view a digraphas a residuated mapping on the power set lattice; as such, we define a graph ona complete lattice as a residuated mapping on that lattice. We extend andgeneralise some results on digraphs to our setting. Secondly, we introduce ageneralised notion of dependency whereby any mapping $\phi$ can depend on anyother mapping $\alpha$.

However, thenature of the singularity remains unclear. We therefore ask: If the initialhypersurface has sufficiently large mean curvature, does the curvaturenecessarily blow up towards the singularity?In case the eigenvalues of the expansion-normalized Weingarten map areeverywhere distinct and satisfy a certain algebraic condition (which in 3+1dimensions is equivalent to them being positive), we prove that this is thecase in the CMC Einstein-non-linear scalar field setting. More specifically, weassociate a set of geometric expansion-normalized quantities to any initialdata set with positive mean curvature. These quantities are expected toconverge, in the quiescent setting, in the direction of crushing big bangsingularities. Our main result says that if the mean curvature is large enough,relative to an appropriate Sobolev norm of these geometric quantities, and ifthe algebraic condition is satisfied, then a quiescent (as opposed tooscillatory) big bang singularity with curvature blow-up forms. This provides astable regime of big bang formation without requiring proximity to anyparticular class of background solutions.An important recent result by Fournodavlos, Rodnianski and Speck demonstratesstable big bang formation for all the spatially flat and spatially homogeneoussolutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations satisfying the algebraiccondition.

As anexample, the standard Sierpi\'nski carpet is quasiself-similar and thus thethree notions of conformal dimension coincide for it.We also give the equality of the three dimensions for combinatorially$p$-Loewner (CLP) spaces. Both proofs involve using a new notion ofcombinatorial modulus, which lies between two notions of modulus that haveappeared in the literature. The first of these is the modulus studied by Pansuand Tyson, which uses a Carath\'eodory construction. The second is the one usedby Keith and Laakso (and later modified and used by Bourdon, Kleiner,Carrasco-Piaggio, Murugan and Shanmugalingam). By combining these approaches,we gain the flexibility of giving upper bounds for the new modulus from thePansu-Tyson approach, and the ability of getting lower bounds using theKeith-Laakso approach. Additionally the new modulus can be iterated inself-similar spaces, which is a crucial, and novel, step in our argument.","['UAS', 'UA', 'ND']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11447

For example, if one wants to find roots, and onechooses initial points in the basin of attraction for 1 root $x^*$ (a factwhich one may not know before hand), then one will always end up in that root.In this case, one would like to have a mechanism to avoid this point $z^*$ inthe next runs of one's algorithm.In this paper, we propose a new method aiming to achieve this: we divide thecost function by an appropriate power of the distance function to $A$. Thisidea is inspired by how one would try to find all roots of a function in 1variable. We first explain the heuristic for this method in the case where theminimum of the cost function is exactly 0, and then explain how to proceed ifthe minimum is non-zero (allowing both positive and negative values).

Janowsky and Lebowitz posed the well-known question ofwhether such very small perturbations could affect the macroscopic current.Different groups of physicists, using a range of heuristics and numericalsimulations reached opposing conclusions on whether the critical value of$\varepsilon$ is 0. This was ultimately resolved rigorously inBasu-Sidoravicius-Sly which established that $\varepsilon_c=0$.Here we study the effect of the current as $\varepsilon$ tends to 0 and indoing so explain why it was so challenging to predict on the basis of numericalsimulations. In particular we show that the current has an infinite order phasetransition at 0, with the effect of the perturbation tending to 0 faster thanany polynomial. Our proof focuses on the Last Passage Percolation formulationof TASEP where a slow bond corresponds to reinforcing the diagonal. We give amultiscale analysis to show that when $\varepsilon$ is small the effect ofreinforcement remains small compared to the difference between optimal and nearoptimal geodesics. Since geodesics can be perturbed on many different scales,we inductively bound the tails of the effect of reinforcement by controllingthe number of near optimal geodesics and giving new tail estimates for thelocal time of (near) geodesics along the diagonal.","['University of California ', 'Princeton University', 'Cal', 'ss@cam.ac.uk', 'University of California', 'allansly@princeton.edu', 'California', 'lfzhang@berkeley.edu']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04563

In the second application, we derivea novel method that modifies the information set (a.k.a. rate profile) of polarcodes and PAC codes in order to reduce the error coefficient, hence improvingtheir performance. More specifically, by analyzing the structure ofminimum-weight codewords of polar codes (as special sums of the rows in thepolar transform matrix), we can identify rows (corresponding to\textit{information} bits) that contribute the most to the formation of suchcodewords and then replace them with other rows (corresponding to\textit{frozen} bits) that bring in few minimum-weight codewords.

Action pairs provide aunified framework for systematically studying such semigroups, within which webuild a suite of tools to ensure a comprehensive understanding of them. We thenapply our abstract results to many special cases of interest.The first part of the paper constitutes a detailed structural analysis ofsemigroups arising from action pairs. We show that any such semigroup $US$ is aquotient of a semidirect product $U\rtimes S$, and we classify all congruenceson semidirect products that correspond to action pairs. We also prove severalcovering and embedding theorems, each of which naturally extends celebratedresults of McAlister on proper (a.k.a. $E$-unitary) inverse semigroups.The second part of the paper concerns presentations by generators andrelations for semigroups arising from action pairs. We develop a substantialbody of general results and techniques that allow us to build presentations for$US$ out of presentations for the constituents $U$ and $S$ in many cases, andthen apply these to several examples, including those listed above. Due to thebroad applicability of the action pair construction, many results in theliterature are special cases of our more general ones.","['SC', 'victoria.gould@york.ac.uk', 'j.east@westernsydney.edu.au', 'dockie@dmi.uns.ac.rs', 'sc@york.ac.uk', 'ridaezenab@iba-suk.edu.pk']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13833

We prove that when $A[x]/(f(x))$is maximal (i.e., integrally closed, i.e., a Dedekind domain), then everysimilarity class contains a representative that is, in a sense, close to beinga companion matrix. The first step in the proof is to show that any similarityclass corresponding to an ideal (not necessarily prime) of degree one containsa representative of the desired form. The second step is a previouslyunpublished result due to Lenstra that implies that when $A[x]/(f(x))$ ismaximal, every ideal class contains an ideal of degree one.","['LUC', 'UC', 'RIC', 'ND', 'RIT', 'LU', 'IC']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02094

If $X\sim\mu_0$, then $X_1,\ldots,X_p$ are conditionally independent.Hence, with a negligible error, one can assume $X\sim\mu_0$ and build$\widetilde{X}$ through NA. Our second result is a characterization of theknockoffs $\widetilde{X}$ obtained via NA. It is shown that $\widetilde{X}$ isof this type if and only if the pair $(X,\widetilde{X})$ can be extended to aninfinite sequence so as to satisfy certain invariance conditions. The basictool for proving this fact is de Finetti's theorem for partially exchangeablesequences. In addition to the quoted results, an explicit formula for theconditional distribution of $\widetilde{X}$ given $X$ is obtained in a fewcases. In one of such cases, it is assumed $X_i\in\{0,1\}$ for all $i$.","['SC', 'UK']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09398

As a result of this, the union ofinteriors of all geodesics going to a fixed point tends to form a tree-likestructure which is supported on a vanishing fraction of the space. Suchgeodesic trees exhibit intricate fractal behaviour; for instance, while almostevery point in the space has only one geodesic going to the fixed point, thereexist atypical points which admit two such geodesics. In this paper, weconsider the directed landscape, the recently constructed scaling limit ofexponential last passage percolation (LPP), with the aim of developing tools toanalyse the fractal aspects of the tree of semi-infinite geodesics in a givendirection. We use the duality (Pimentel '16) between the geodesic tree and theinterleaving competition interfaces in exponential LPP to obtain a dualitybetween the geodesic tree and the corresponding dual tree in the landscape.Using this, we show that problems concerning the fractal behaviour of sets ofatypical points for the geodesic tree can be transformed into correspondingproblems for the dual tree, which might turn out to be easier. In particular,we use this method to show that the set of points admitting two semi-infinitegeodesics in a fixed direction a.s. has Hausdorff dimension $4/3$, therebyanswering a question posed in Busani-Sepp\""{a}l\""{a}inen-Sorensen '22.

Our results concern both shallow random Gaussian neural networks withunivariate output and fully connected and deep random Gaussian neural networks,with a rather general activation function. The upper bounds show how the widthsof the layers, the activation functions and other architecture parametersaffect the Gaussian approximation of the ouput. Our techniques, relying onStein's method and integration by parts formulas for the Gaussian law, yieldestimates on distances which are indeed integral probability metrics, andinclude the total variation and the convex distances. These latter metrics aredefined by testing against indicator functions of suitable measurable sets, andso allow for accurate estimates of the probability that the output is localizedin some region of the space.

Wedevelop an experimental design and computational methods that combines geneticvariants associated with OUD with behavioral features extracted from GPS andWi-Fi spatiotemporal coordinates to assess OUD risk.

We show that integrating genetic and mobility modalities improves riskmodelling using classification accuracy, area under the precision-recall andreceiver operator characteristic curves, and $F_1$ score.

Varying migration rates inducesboth continuous and discontinuous phase transitions at which ecotypes exchangestability. These transitions result in ecotype extinction or emergence, whichmay have significant health implications. At the discontinuous transitions,there is no population decline to warn of an impending tipping point, yet thestatistics of population fluctuations encode a warning signal of an approachingtransition. We find that the discontinuous phase transitions arise via a novelmechanism of simultaneous transcritical bifurcations.

However, the quantity and quality of labeled fossil images areoften limited due to fossil preservation, conditioned sampling, and expensiveand inconsistent label annotation by domain experts, which pose greatchallenges to training deep learning based image classification models. Toaddress these challenges, we follow the idea of the wisdom of crowds andpropose a multiview ensemble framework, which collects Original (O), Gray (G),and Skeleton (S) views of each fossil image reflecting its differentcharacteristics to train multiple base models, and then makes the finaldecision via soft voting.

While considering the identification consistency estimationwith respect to human experts, OGS receives the highest agreement with theoriginal labels of dataset and with the re-identifications of two humanexperts. We conclude that the proposed framework can present state-of-the-artperformance in the fusulinid fossil identification case study. This frameworkis designed for general fossil identification and it is expected to seeapplications to other fossil datasets in future work.

In the research carried out, we dedicated our attention to thegene CsZCD, an important player in the formation of apocarotenoids. Through theapplication of real-time polymerase chain reaction to RNA purified from saffronstigmas at various growth phases, it was determined that the peak expression ofthe CsZCD gene coincided with the red stage, which is associated with thehighest concentration of apocarotenoids. The data showed a 2.69-foldenhancement in CsZCD gene expression during the red phase, whereas a 0.90-foldand 0.69-fold reduction was noted at the stages characterized by orange andyellow hues, respectively. A noteworthy observation was that CsZCD's expressionwas three times that of the CsTUB gene. Additionally, relative to CsTUB, CsLYCdisplayed 0.7-fold and 0.3-times expression. Our investigation provides insightinto the governance of CsZCD during stigma maturation and its possibleinfluence on the fluctuation in apocarotenoid content.

How the connectivity ofnetworks of conductance-based neuron models like the classical Hodgkin-Huxleymodel, or the Morris-Lecar model, impacts synchronizability remains unknown.One powerful tool to resolve the synchronizability of these networks is theMaster Stability Function (MSF). Here, we apply and extend the MSF approach tonetworks of Morris-Lecar neurons with conductance-based coupling to determineunder which parameters and graphs synchronous solutions are stable. We considerconnectivity graphs with a constant row-sum, where the MSF approach can bereadily extended to conductance-based synapses rather than the morewell-studied diffusive connectivity case, which primarily applies to gapjunction connectivity. In this formulation, the synchronous solution is asingle, self-coupled or 'autaptic' neuron. We find that the primary determiningparameter for the stability of the synchronous solution is, unsurprisingly, thereversal potential, as it largely dictates the excitatory/inhibitory potentialof a synaptic connection. However, the change between ""excitatory"" and""inhibitory'' synapses is rapid, with only a few millivolts separatingstability and instability of the synchronous state for most graphs. We alsofind that for specific coupling strengths (as measured by the global synapticconductance), islands of synchronizability in the MSF can emerge for inhibitoryconnectivity. We verified the stability of these islands by direct simulationof pairs of neurons coupled with eigenvalues in the matching spectrum.

The double-scaled matrix integral has as itsleading density of states the universal Cardy density of primaries in atwo-dimensional CFT, thus motivating the name Virasoro minimal string. Theduality holds for any value of the continuous parameter $c$ and reduces to theJT gravity/matrix integral duality in the large central charge limit. It thusprovides a precise stringy realization of JT gravity. The main observables ofthe Virasoro minimal string are quantum analogues of the Weil-Peterssonvolumes, which are computed as absolutely convergent integrals of worldsheetCFT correlators over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.By exploiting a relation of the Virasoro minimal string to three-dimensionalgravity and intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, we areable to give a direct derivation of the duality.

Our proofrelies on a careful analysis of the radiative phase space admitting suchgravitational tails, and the determination of the fluxes through null infinity$\mathscr I$ that act as canonical generators of superrotations on bothgravitational and matter fields. All logarithmic terms are derived from thefluxes through correlations of the supertranslation Goldstone mode, providedcare is taken in manipulating gravitationally interacting (i.e. dressed) ratherthan free fields.

However, Weyl anomaly could breakexplicitly this gauge symmetry, hence we study it in Weyl geometry. We firstnote that in Weyl geometry {\it metricity} can be restored with respect to anew differential operator ($\hat \nabla$) that also enforces a Weyl-covariantformulation. This leads to a metric-like Weyl gauge invariant formalism thatenables one to do quantum calculations directly in Weyl geometry, rather thanuse a Riemannian (metric) geometry picture. The result is the Weyl-covariancein $d$ dimensions of all geometric operators ($\hat R$, etc) {\it and} of theirderivatives ($\hat\nabla_\mu\hat R$, etc), including the Euler-Gauss-Bonnetterm.

This new object has zero conformal weight and isgiven by $\phi^{2/\Delta}g_{\mu \nu}$, where ($-\Delta$) is the conformaldimension of the scalar. As $g_{\mu \nu}$ has conformal dimension of 2, theresulting tensor is trivially a conformal invariant. Then, the generatedscalar-tensor theory, which we call the Weyl uplift of the original purelymetric theory, is obtained by replacing the metric by $\hat{g}_{\mu \nu}$ inthe action that defines the original theory. This prescription allowed us todefine the Weyl uplift of theories with terms of higher order in the Riemanniancurvature. Furthermore, the prescription for scalar-tensor theories coming fromterms that have explicit covariant derivatives in the Lagrangian is discussed.The same mechanism can also be used for the derivation of the equations ofmotion of the scalar-tensor theory from the original field equations in theEinstein frame. Applying this method of Weyl uplift allowed us to reproduce theknown result for the conformal scalar coupling to Lovelock gravity and toderive that of Einsteinian cubic gravity.

An ideal characterizationshould distinguish different functional regions with robustness to noise andidiosyncrasies of individual brains that do not correspond to computationaldifferences. Previous studies have characterized brain representations by theirrepresentational geometry, which is defined by the representationaldissimilarity matrix (RDM), a summary statistic that abstracts from the rolesof individual neurons (or responses channels) and characterizes thediscriminability of stimuli. Here we explore a further step of abstraction:from the geometry to the topology of brain representations. We proposetopological representational similarity analysis (tRSA), an extension ofrepresentational similarity analysis (RSA) that uses a family ofgeo-topological summary statistics that generalizes the RDM to characterize thetopology while de-emphasizing the geometry. We evaluate this new family ofstatistics in terms of the sensitivity and specificity for model selectionusing both simulations and functional MRI (fMRI) data. In the simulations, theground truth is a data-generating layer representation in a neural networkmodel and the models are the same and other layers in different model instances(trained from different random seeds). In fMRI, the ground truth is a visualarea and the models are the same and other areas measured in differentsubjects. Results show that topology-sensitive characterizations of populationcodes are robust to noise and interindividual variability and maintainexcellent sensitivity to the unique representational signatures of differentneural network layers and brain regions.","['Columbia University', 'ND', 'NEU', 'n.kriegeskorte@columbia.edu']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11028

Weuse the observed data directly to account for all sources of uncertainty,instead of relying on prior estimation of the underlying densities in atwo-step approach, which can be inaccurate if small or heterogeneous numbers ofsamples per density are available. To account for the constrained nature ofdensities, we base our approach on Bayes spaces, which extend the Aitchisongeometry for compositional data to density functions. For modeling, we exploitthe isometric isomorphism between the Bayes space and the $\mathbb{L}^2$subspace $\mathbb{L}_0^2$ with integration-to-zero constraint through thecentered log-ratio transformation. As only discrete draws from each density areobserved, we treat the underlying functional densities as latent variableswithin a maximum likelihood framework and employ a Monte Carlo ExpectationMaximization (MCEM) algorithm for model estimation.

We formulate the problem as one ofconstrained optimisation, where we seek a low-complexity, data-dependentselection set on which, with a guaranteed probability, the regression functionis uniformly at least as large as the threshold; subject to this constraint, wewould like the region to contain as much mass under the marginal featuredistribution as possible. This leads to a natural notion of regret, and ourmain contribution is to determine the minimax optimal rate for this regret inboth the sample size and the Type I error probability. The rate involves adelicate interplay between parameters that control the smoothness of theregression function, as well as exponents that quantify the extent to which theoptimal selection set at the population level can be approximated by familiesof well-behaved subsets.

NA hasessentially three advantages: (i) To build $\widetilde{X}$ is straightforward;(ii) The joint distribution of $(X,\widetilde{X})$ can be written in closedform; (iii) $\widetilde{X}$ is often optimal under various criteria. However,for NA to apply, $X_1,\ldots, X_p$ should be conditionally independent givensome random element $Z$. Our first result is that any probability measure $\mu$on $\mathbb{R}^p$ can be approximated by a probability measure $\mu_0$ of theform $$\mu_0\bigl(A_1\times\ldots\times A_p\bigr)=E\Bigl\{\prod_{i=1}^pP(X_i\in A_i\mid Z)\Bigr\}.$$ The approximation is in total variation distancewhen $\mu$ is absolutely continuous, and an explicit formula for $\mu_0$ isprovided. If $X\sim\mu_0$, then $X_1,\ldots,X_p$ are conditionally independent.Hence, with a negligible error, one can assume $X\sim\mu_0$ and build$\widetilde{X}$ through NA. Our second result is a characterization of theknockoffs $\widetilde{X}$ obtained via NA. It is shown that $\widetilde{X}$ isof this type if and only if the pair $(X,\widetilde{X})$ can be extended to aninfinite sequence so as to satisfy certain invariance conditions. The basictool for proving this fact is de Finetti's theorem for partially exchangeablesequences. In addition to the quoted results, an explicit formula for theconditional distribution of $\widetilde{X}$ given $X$ is obtained in a fewcases.

More specifically, we introduce a principled methodthat searches for a latent geometry composed of a product of constant curvaturemodel spaces with minimal query evaluations. To accomplish this, we propose anovel notion of distance between candidate latent geometries based on theGromov-Hausdorff distance from metric geometry. In order to compute theGromov-Hausdorff distance, we introduce a mapping function that enables thecomparison of different manifolds by embedding them in a commonhigh-dimensional ambient space. Finally, we design a graph search space basedon the calculated distances between candidate manifolds and use Bayesianoptimization to search for the optimal latent geometry in a query-efficientmanner. This is a general method which can be applied to search for the optimallatent geometry for a variety of models and downstream tasks. Extensiveexperiments on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the efficacy of ourmethod in identifying the optimal latent geometry for multiple machine learningproblems.",[],2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.0481

Using a Bayesianmultinomial regression model, we find that, after adjusting for confounderslike batter and pitcher quality, handedness, and home field advantage, there islittle evidence of strong discontinuity in pitcher performance between timesthrough the order.

In a simpleBayesian model of belief formation via costly information acquisition, peopleform precise beliefs when these beliefs are important for theirdecision-making. The precision of prior beliefs controls how much their beliefsshift when they are shown new information (i.e., the strength of the firststage). Since two-stage least squares (TSLS) targets a weighted average withweights proportional to the strength of the first stage, TSLS will overweightindividuals with smaller causal effects and underweight those with largereffects, thus understating the average partial effect of beliefs on behavior.In experimental designs where all participants are exposed to new information,Bayesian updating implies that a control function can be used to identify the(unweighted) average partial effect. I apply this estimator to a recent studyof the effects of beliefs about the gender wage gap on support for publicpolicies (Settele, 2022) and find the average partial effect is 40% larger thanthe comparable TSLS estimate. This difference can be explained by the fact thatthe effects of beliefs are close to zero for people who update their beliefsthe most and receive the most weight in TSLS specifications.","['University of Chicago', 'dbe@uchicago.edu']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11387

We quantify thetechnoeconomic potential of coupling a synthetic fuel production process withfive example nuclear power plants across the U.S. to explore the influence ofdifferent electricity markets, access to carbon dioxide sources, and fuelmarkets.

As aresult, the decoder, especially its upsampling component, plays a crucial rolein enhancing segmentation outcomes.

In this paper, we propose a real-timecross-platform neural video codec, which is capable of efficiently decoding of720P video bitstream from other encoding platforms on a consumer-grade GPU.First, to solve the problem of inconsistency of codec caused by the uncertaintyof floating point calculations across platforms, we design a calibrationtransmitting system to guarantee the consistent quantization of entropyparameters between the encoding and decoding stages. The parameters that mayhave transboundary quantization between encoding and decoding are identified inthe encoding stage, and their coordinates will be delivered by auxiliarytransmitted bitstream.

This simplifies the overall matching problem into independentIHR-level matching problems and an upper-level optimal power flow problem tomeet the IHR-level upstream flow requirements while respecting the gridconstraints. Within each IHR, the agent employs a scalable Deep ReinforcementLearning algorithm to identify matching solutions such that the customer'sservice constraints are met. The central agent then solves an optimal powerflow problem with the IHRs as the nodes, with their active power flow andreactive power {capacities}, and grid constraints to scalably determine thefinal flows such that matched power can be delivered to the extent the gridconstraints are satisfied.

Withclassical techniques facing troubles to deal with the irregular (non-Euclidean)domain where the signals are defined, a popular approach at the heart of graphsignal processing (GSP) is to: (i) represent the underlying support via a graphand (ii) exploit the topology of this graph to process the signals at hand. Inaddition to the irregular structure of the signals, another critical limitationis that the observed data is prone to the presence of perturbations, which, inthe context of GSP, may affect not only the observed signals but also thetopology of the supporting graph. Ignoring the presence of perturbations, alongwith the couplings between the errors in the signal and the errors in theirsupport, can drastically hinder estimation performance. While many GSP workshave looked at the presence of perturbations in the signals, much fewer havelooked at the presence of perturbations in the graph, and almost none at theirjoint effect. While this is not surprising (GSP is a relatively new field), weexpect this to change in the upcoming years. Motivated by the previousdiscussion, the goal of this thesis is to advance toward a robust GSP paradigmwhere the algorithms are carefully designed to incorporate the influence ofperturbations in the graph signals, the graph support, and both.

The estimation of cognitive load using pupil diameter typicallyinvolves measures relative to a baseline. Instead, we conducted an eye-trackingstudy using the Low/High Index of Pupillary Activity to evaluate healthcareexperts and non-experts analyzing the faces with and without pain from adataset of newborn faces. This data was recorded by the Tobii TX300eye-tracking system in a closed room with controlled lighting.

While Low Earth Orbit (LEO)broadband satellites help to connect unconnected communities and achieve theSustainable Development Goals, there are also a range of negative environmentalexternalities, from the burning of rocket fuels and resulting environmentalemissions. We present sustainability analytics for phase 1 of the three mainLEO constellations including Amazon Kuiper (3,236 satellites), OneWeb (648satellites), and SpaceX Starlink (4,425 satellites). In baseline scenarios overfive years, we find a per subscriber carbon dioxide equivalent (CO$_2$eq) of0.70$\pm$0.34 tonnes for Kuiper, 1.41$\pm$0.71 tonnes for OneWeb and0.47$\pm$0.15 tonnes CO$_2$eq/subscriber for Starlink.

The standard approach in thearea are mass univariate analyses across genetic factors and imagingphenotypes. That entails executing one genome-wide association study (GWAS) foreach pre-defined imaging measure. Although this approach has been tremendouslysuccessful, one shortcoming is that phenotypes must be pre-defined.Consequently, effects that are not confined to pre-selected regions of interestor that reflect larger brain-wide patterns can easily be missed. In this workwe introduce a Partial Least Squares (PLS)-based framework, which we termCluster-Bootstrap PLS (CLUB-PLS), that can work with large input dimensions inboth domains as well as with large sample sizes. One key factor of theframework is to use cluster bootstrap to provide robust statistics for singleinput features in both domains. We applied CLUB-PLS to investigating thegenetic basis of surface area and cortical thickness in a sample of 33,000subjects from the UK Biobank. We found 107 genome-wide significantlocus-phenotype pairs that are linked to 386 different genes.

However, the provided safety assurances areoften predicated on the assumption that once deployed, the system or itsenvironment does not evolve. Online, however, an autonomous system mightexperience changes in system dynamics, control authority, externaldisturbances, and/or the surrounding environment, requiring updated safetyassurances. Rather than restarting the safety analysis from scratch, which canbe time-consuming and often intractable to perform online, we propose tocompute \textit{parameter-conditioned} reachable sets. Assuming expected systemand environment changes can be parameterized, we treat these parameters asvirtual states in the system and leverage recent advances in high-dimensionalreachability analysis to solve the corresponding reachability problem offline.This results in a family of reachable sets that is parameterized by theenvironment and system factors. Online, as these factors change, the system cansimply query the corresponding safety function from this family to ensuresystem safety, enabling a real-time update of the safety assurances.

By pre-processing the speech signal it is possible to improve thespeech intelligibility and quality -- this is known as near-end listeningenhancement (NLE). Although, existing NLE techniques are able to greatlyincrease intelligibility in harsh noise environments, in favorable noiseconditions the intelligibility of speech reaches a ceiling where it cannot befurther enhanced. Actually, the focus of existing methods solely on improvingthe intelligibility causes unnecessary processing of the speech signal andleads to speech distortions and quality degradations. In this paper, we providea new rationale for NLE, where the target speech is minimally processed interms of a processing penalty, provided that a certain performance constraint,e.g., intelligibility, is satisfied. We present a closed-form solution for thecase where the performance criterion is an intelligibility estimator based onthe approximated speech intelligibility index and the processing penalty is themean-square error between the processed and the clean speech. This produces anNLE method that adapts to changing noise conditions via a simple gain rule bylimiting the processing to the minimum necessary to achieve a desiredintelligibility, while at the same time focusing on quality in favorable noisesituations by minimizing the amount of speech distortions. Through simulationstudies, we show the proposed method attains speech quality on par or betterthan existing methods in both objective measurements and subjective listeningtests, whilst still sustaining objective speech intelligibility performance onpar with existing methods.","['GU', 'ODU', 'UC', 'UA', 'ND', 'AU', 'UD', 'OC']",2023-09-21,arXiv,https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17154
