       "('A continued and unprecedented demand for England’s child protection services has coincided with increasing numbers of children being made subject to Care Orders within the Family Court. There is a growing understanding of the associated challenges—not least in terms of cost and placement availability. However, there has been limited discussion of the difficulties associated with children being made subject to a Care Order, but who remain living at home with their parents. This article reports on an iterative mixed method study which sought to explore child protection social workers’ experiences of ‘Care Orders at home’. This article reports on the prevalence of ‘Care Orders at home’ within Northwest England and identifies specific challenges in the context of ‘managing child protection partners’ expectations’; apparent ‘confusion and disempowerment of the child and family’ and ‘an increased sense of risk’ with respect to several of the key stakeholders involved. Implications that emerge from the study are that a ‘Care Order at home’ might, in some circumstances, be considered as a ‘contradictory’ and therefore ‘confusing’ concept, and that it can offer less protection to a child than a care plan for ‘No Order’ running concurrently to a detailed child protection plan.',\n",

       "'The current investment treaty system is, by its nature, highly fragmented, and there is a large potential for conflict, within the system and with other fields of public international law. Several States have already been exposed to conflicts within the investment treaty system, as well as collisions with other treaty regimes. The CME v Czech Republic and Lauder v Czech Republic cases2 are the prime examples— also referred to as the ‘ultimate fiasco in investment arbitration’3—of investment arbitrations resulting in directly contradictory outcomes. While the Lauder v Czech Republic Tribunal denied all claims for damages by the ultimate shareholder of a Czech television broadcasting company, the CME v Czech Republic Tribunal, 10 days later, awarded the Dutch investment vehicle compensation for several treaty violations based on the same treatment of the same investment and applying essentially the same investment treaty standards.4 EU Member States have also experienced clashes between investment treaties and European Union law. Eastern Sugar v Czech Republic5 became the first publicly known of many intra-EU investment treaty arbitrations in which EU Member States raised, and investment tribunals rejected, jurisdictional objections based on the incompatibility between intra-EU BITs and EU law. The potential for future conflicts remains high. For example, conflicts with international environmental law are likely to arise in the context of actions taken by States to address climate change and facilitate energy transition.6 Tensions may also arise with international humanitarian law since international investment law and the law of armed conflict balance private property rights differently.7 '"
