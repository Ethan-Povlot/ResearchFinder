    "abstract = 'From scary stories to horror films and haunted houses, the horror genre is wildly popular. Although horror aims to elicit fear and anxiety, many people with anxiety are horror fans and some report using horror to cope with anxiety. In this article, we provide a theoretical rationale for why people with anxiety might choose to access and find relief in horror films. First, we discuss aspects of horror that could make it alluring to people with anxiety and how the use of horror may be negatively reinforcing. Next, we examine how engagement with horror could be used to build skills for resilience in generalized situations. We build on processes from evidence-based therapies (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy and exposure therapy) to explain how horror media has the potential to be used as a therapeutic tool. Finally, we discuss steps for future research on horror as a therapeutic tool for anxiety-related disorders.'\n",
    "abstract2 = 'Intriguingly, the horror genre, renowned for evoking fear and trepidation, has garnered immense popularity across various media forms, from spine-chilling tales to unsettling cinematic experiences and spine-tingling haunted attractions. Paradoxically, amidst its spine-tingling narratives and heart-pounding scares, a noteworthy phenomenon emerges: individuals grappling with anxiety often find solace and intrigue within the realm of horror. This article endeavors to elucidate the theoretical underpinnings that underlie the inclination of individuals with anxiety towards engaging with horror content, delving into the potential reasons behind this intriguing connection.'\n",
    "#first 2 are similar 3 is different\n",
    "abstract3 = 'That there was variation in the theories expounded by the major early thinkers on evolution is well established. What is less effectively articulated is how their intellectual ambitions and approaches to interpreting evidence reflect a deep-rooted difference in their views on what sort of systems, and problems evolution deals with; insights which speak directly to contemporary debates about how we communicate the nature of science with consequences for learning practice. We provide a re-reading of the perspectives adopted by those who formulated the central concepts of evolutionary theory to expose slender but persistent differences of emphasis. Our analysis contrasts the approaches to enquiry of three voyaging naturalists; Charles Darwin, Thomas Henry Huxley, and Alfred Russel Wallace. This potted history is used to illustrate the relationship between different traditions of scientific enquiry, specifically the natural philosophy approach characteristic of Wallace’s work and the later Neo-Darwinists; Huxley’s more empirical, natural history approach that anticipated punctuated equilibria, and Darwin’s emphasis on agency and choice, which suggests a more humanistic mind-set. These understandings are used to propose a model of the structure of evolutionary science which has broader value as a motif for exploring and communicating the transitions between different modes of enquiry.'\n",
