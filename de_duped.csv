0,3enxf,['Philip Deming'],['Psychiatry'],Burning neuroscientific questions about etiological models of psychopathy,"Numerous etiological models have been proposed for psychopathy, a disorder that leaves a devastating impact on society. There is a need for developing treatments that target the relevant mechanisms proposed by these models. But first, there is a need to refine the etiological models. Toward this aim, I pose three questions guided by what is known about the architecture of the human brain, and how that architecture shapes function. In question 1, I ask whether the paralimbic hypothesis implicates the whole brain. Given its myelo- and cytoarchitecture, paralimbic cortex sits atop multiple neural hierarchies. This position allows paralimbic cortex to send feedback signals down these hierarchies, shaping sensory signals from the body and world before they arrive. In question 2, I ask what the low fear theory predicts about brain function. Most previous neuroscientific applications of this theory have posited low amygdala activity as the brain basis of psychopathic individuals’ purported fearlessness. I emphasize the need for a new neuroscientific application of the low fear theory, one that accounts for the distributed and context-specific brain activity that creates fear. In question 3, I ask how the brain creates goal states, and I explore implications for two models of psychopathy that assign a prominent role to goal states. Evidence from the field of reinforcement learning shows that the brain adaptively employs a spectrum of behavioral control strategies, ranging from model-free (i.e., habitual) to model-based (i.e., goal-directed). Psychopathic people may have difficulty adaptively implementing primarily model-based strategies.",https://psyarxiv.com/3enxf/,2023-09-21T22:29:11.846828,"['Northeastern University', 'NEU', 'DC', 'p.deming@northeastern.edu', 'State', 'Cal', 'UK', 'SC', 'USA', 'Brown', ' State']",OSF,

Associations Between Momentary Self-Esteem, Daily Social Interactions, and Self-Esteem Development in Late Adolescence and Late Adulthood","Research over the past two decades has repeatedly shown that the evaluation of one’s own worth—trait self-esteem—is closely linked to the quality of social relationships and perceptions of social inclusion. However, there is limited evidence on the dynamics between momentary self-esteem and perceptions of social inclusion in everyday life, as well as on their possible long-term (bottom-up) effects on the development of trait self-esteem. We addressed this research gap using longitudinal data from a German multi-methodological study (N = 324) in which N = 235 late adolescents (Mage = 17.7; 76% female) and N = 89 older adults (Mage = 63.8; 64% female) were followed over one year. Based on three trait questionnaires with six-month intervals and a 7-day experience-sampling burst at the first measurement point, we investigated momentary dynamics in self-esteem and longitudinal change by using multilevel and latent growth modeling. Results confirmed the positive association between momentary self-esteem and perceptions of social inclusion in everyday life, that is, self-esteem reactivity in both age groups. In addition, both self- and other reports showed a consistent increase in trait self-esteem over one year. However, because the slope parameters did not indicate substantial interindividual variance, we were unable to test for bottom-up effects of self-esteem reactivity. We discuss the importance of daily social experiences for momentary self-esteem in late adolescence and late adulthood, but also point to the need for further multi-methodological research.",https://psyarxiv.com/rzbq9/,2023-09-21T20:38:19.575369,['ND'],OSF,

Increased autocorrelation (AR) of system-specific measures has been suggested as a predictor for critical transitions in complex systems. Increased AR of mood scores has been reported to anticipate depressive episodes in major depressive disorder, while other studies found AR increases to be associated with depressive episodes themselves. Data on AR in patients with bipolar disorders (BD) is limited and inconclusive.

Methods. Patients with BD reported their current mood via daily e-diaries for 12 months. Current affective status (euthymic, prodromal, depressed, (hypo)manic) was assessed in 26 bi-weekly expert interviews. Exploratory analyses tested whether self-reported current mood and AR of the same item could differentiate between prodromal phases or affective episodes and euthymia.

Results. A total of 29 depressive and 20 (hypo)manic episodes were observed in 29 participants with BD. Self-reported current mood was significantly decreased during in the two weeks prior to a depressive episode (early prodromal, late prodromal), but not changed prior to manic episodes. The AR was neither a significant predictor for the early or late prodromal phase of depression, nor for the early prodromal phase of (hypo)mania. Decreased AR was found in the late prodromal phase of (hypo)mania. Increased AR was mainly found during depressive episodes. 

Conclusions.  AR changes might not be better at predicting depressive episodes than simple self-report measures on current mood in patients with BD. Increased AR was mostly found during depressive episodes. Potentially, changes in AR might anticipate (hypo)manic episodes.",https://psyarxiv.com/8ebmc/,2023-09-21T19:52:07.403317,"['Vera.Ludwig@ukdd.de', 'Central']",OSF,

While the ability to remember the general idea or gist of past episodes is relatively preserved from the effects of aging, the ability to remember the verbatim details of these episodes declines. The aim of the present study was to examine whether age-related differences in the quality of episodic representations could be reduced by manipulations of information encoding. Two experiments were conducted with younger adults (N = 63, 18-27 years old) and older adults (N = 61, 54-81 years old) in which either the retrieval of gist representations of studied items was facilitated by presenting items that could be grouped within the same category (Experiment 1) or the retrieval of verbatim details of studied items was facilitated by presenting the same items repeatedly (Experiment 2). Both manipulations proved effective in increasing retrieval of either gist or verbatim representations in a recognition task in younger and older adults. Increasing gist retrieval improved correct recognition performance for both younger and older adults, but also led the latter to make more recognition errors. Increasing verbatim retrieval improved correct recognition performance for both younger and older adults, and the gain was greater for older adults. These findings support the notion that age-related changes in episodic memory can be explained by changes in representational specificity and suggest that simple encoding manipulations could improve episodic memory in older adults.",https://psyarxiv.com/djt9v/,2023-09-21T19:42:43.865344,"['MU', 'BU', 'Pitt', 'PC']",OSF,

Despite the proclaimed goal to develop a democracy based on market principles and sound regulatory principles, Serbia's regulatory state appears to remain unconsolidated. The research reveals deviations from the key principles of the regulatory state, such as the government's non-interference in markets and commitment to Better Regulation guidelines. During the transition period from 2001 to 2023, Serbia's regulatory approach has blended various elements, including features of the developmental state. To grasp the trajectory of the regulatory state's lack of consolidation, decay, reversal, and replacement, we need to consider a consolidation perspective in addition to the prevalent ‘modelling perspective’. The latter mainly distinguishes between the ‘Regulatory State of the South’ and the ‘Regulatory State of the Global North’. The observed lack of consolidation in Serbia's case study calls for a rethinking of theories on internationalisation and trends in global governance's transnationalisation. It implies the possibility of the rise of varied regulatory models, even in countries close to the Global North and within the EU's neighbourhood, diverging from the traditional regulatory state paradigm. This study adds to the conversation on regulatory state frameworks and sheds light on the intricate paths and potential futures of regulatory states in countries undergoing transition.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7g9zx/,2023-09-21T22:44:10.784438,"['ognjen.dragicevic@fpn.bg.ac.rs', ' State', 'slobodan.tomic@york.ac.uk', 'State', 'UK']",OSF,

The analysis compares legislation from three countries in Southeast Europe: Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It examines whether two key components of legal design, namely (i) the discretion granted to institutions within the criminal justice system and political establishment and (ii) the presence of checks and balances systems within MLA procedures, have a positive or negative impact on MLA policy in practice. The analysis reveals that, although the three countries share many similarities in their legal arrangements pertaining to MLA procedures, there are some variations in specific forms of MLA, in terms of the discretion granted to domestic actors and the presence of checks and balances within the procedure. The findings show that significant discretion given to specific actors within the MLA policy can pave the way for harmful practices such as arbitrariness, uneven application of the law, and potential political abuse. The study also highlights the value of incorporating built-in checks and balances within the MLA procedure to ensure accountability and mutual control mechanisms, confirming that, where such mechanisms are not present, appropriate accountability and control safeguards are missing, enabling potential abuse of power or neglect in handling the MLA procedure. At the same time, it emerges that these checks and balances, whether they include internal review mechanisms, joint decision-making models, and/or approval powers ('de facto vetoing'), should not be excessive or burdensome to avoid obstructing the MLA processes.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5zfmg/,2023-09-21T22:48:42.366159,"['Western', 'slobodan.tomic@york.ac.uk', 'E.David-Barrett@sussex.ac.uk', 'UK']",OSF,

All humans rely on social learning to acquire culture, but there is substantial variation across societies, between individuals and over developmental time. However, it is unclear why these differences exist. Here, we present an evolutionary model showing that individual variation in social learning can emerge if the benefits of social learning are unpredictable. Unpredictability selects for flexible developmental programmes that allow individuals to update their reliance on social learning based on previous experiences. This developmental flexibility, in turn, causes some individuals in a population to end up consistently relying more heavily on social learning than others. We demonstrate this core evolutionary mechanism across three scenarios of increasing complexity, investigating the impact of different sources of uncertainty about the usefulness of social learning. Our results show how evolution can shape how individuals learn to learn from others, with potentially profound effects on cultural diversity.",https://psyarxiv.com/gxubv/,2023-09-21T18:26:33.244261,['KU'],OSF,

There is a persistent delay in leaving the parental home, particularly among women, who leave at similar ages as men in recent cohorts. Leaving home for marriage has decreased, replaced by cohabitation and independent living. A substantial social class gradient is evident in the timing of leaving home, particularly for women. Social class disparities also extend to patterns of leaving home for marriage or living alone, whereas cohabitation shows less class differentiation. Children of the working class are more likely to leave home for marriage than those from the service class and daughters from families with no employment history or deceased parents at younger ages.

In addition, emotional states, such as anxiety, shape our visual systems, increasing overall, and particularly threat-related, sensitivity. It remains unclear, however, how anxiety interacts with additional cues when categorizing sensory input. This is especially important in social scenarios where ambiguous gestures are commonplace, thus requiring the integration of cues for a proper interpretation. To this end, we decided to assess how states of anxiety might bias the perception of potentially aggressive social interactions, and how external cues are incorporated in this process. Participants (N = 71) were tasked with signalling the presence of aggression in ambiguous social interactions. Simultaneously, an observer (facial expression) reacted (by showing an emotional expression) to this interaction. Importantly, participants performed this task under safety and threat of shock conditions. Decision measures and eye tracking data were collected. Our results showed that threat of shock did not affect sensitivity nor criterion when detecting aggressive interactions. The same pattern was observed for response times. Drift diffusion modelling analysis, however, suggested quicker evidence accumulation when under threat. Lastly, dwell times over the observer were higher when under threat, indicating a possible association between anxiety states and a bias towards potentially threat-related indicators.

because learners differ on multiple dimensions. The present study tests a person-centered
approach to investigating differential effectiveness, in this case of reading instruction. In N =
517 German third-grade students, latent profile analysis identified four subgroups that
differed across multiple characteristics consistent with the simple view of reading: poor
decoders, poor comprehenders, poor readers, and good readers. Over a school year, different
instructional foci showed differential effectiveness for students in these different profiles. An
instructional focus on vocabulary primarily benefited good readers at the expense of poor
decoders and poor comprehenders, while a focus on advanced reading abilities benefitted
poor comprehenders at the expense of poor decoders and good readers. These findings are in
contrast to those obtained by multiple regression, which, because they focused on only one
learner characteristic at a time, would have suggested different and potentially misleading
implications for instruction. Thus, this study provides initial evidence for the advantages of a

One of its less recognized effects, however, lies in perception alterations caused by how one weighs sensory evidence, that in turn might affect social communication. Here, we investigated how anxiety affects our ability to gather and use social cues to anticipate the action of others. We adapted a paradigm to assess expectations in social scenarios, whereby participants were asked to identify the presence of agents therein, while supported by action cues (communicative vs individual actions) from another agent. Participants (N=66) underwent this task under safe and threat-of-shock block conditions. We extracted criterion and sensitivity measures to evaluate participants’ response patterns. Gaze data was also collected. Our analysis showed that whilst the type of action had the expected effect (i.e., lower criterion for communicative actions), threat-of-shock had no effect over any response measurements. Furthermore, eye tracker data revealed no differences in dwell time across conditions when searching for cues but showed that, under threat, participants exhibited shorter fixation durations.

Encoding associations in memory tends to be a more difficult task than item encoding as associative memory requires encoding multiple items as well as the specific links amongst the items. Associative memory has been shown to require cortical medial temporal lobe (MTL) engagement, to process context and item information, respectively, in addition to hippocampal engagement that is needed for the binding of distinct information. The need to engage greater and more disparate neural resources in order to execute associative encoding tasks often comes at a cost with respect to memory success, notably, there is poorer associative memory compared to item memory performance. Accordingly, researchers have worked to identify interventions and strategies aimed at reducing the effort and neural resources required for successful associative memory processing. One such means of support is the concept of unitization. Unitization has traditionally been defined as the process by which two or more discrete items are processed, or encoded, such that they are perceived as a single ensemble. The current review will explore the neural research on unitization while taking into account the behavioral benefits that accompany the process.",https://psyarxiv.com/sbyr2/,2023-09-21T12:53:10.807712,"['Penn', 'NEU', ' State', 'Pennsylvania State University', 'State', 'IC', 'SC', 'Penn State', 'CMC', 'HC']",OSF,

As a consequence, a conservation incentive exists to stress inter-population differences to define taxa, potentially leading to taxonomic inflation. But stressing the uniqueness of threatened populations has the side effect of hindering conservation actions that promote inter-population gene flow, such as genetic rescue. These actions may be of critical importance for severely inbred populations involved in extinction vortices, for which an inflated taxonomy can become a conservation trap. Here, we exemplify this scenario with the western capercaillie population in the Cantabrian Mountains, described and legally listed as a subspecies not supported by recent molecular data. The Cantabrian capercaillie population is Critically Endangered after a long-lasting decline and a recent demographic collapse. It shows clear signs of inbreeding depression, including striking clutch size decreases as well as reduced hatchability and chick survival. This critical situation could be alleviated through a genetic rescue, but this possibility is hindered by inertias rooted in the putative uniqueness of the Cantabrian capercaillie. It had been previously argued that poor taxonomy could hamper conservation, through the oblivion of populations deserving, but not having, a taxonomic status. We show that taxonomic inflation can also become an obstacle for effective conservation.",https://osf.io/jfg7v/,2023-09-21T13:18:42.034351,"['ODU', 'miguelclavero@ebd.csic.es', 'IC', 'UC']",OSF,

Mapping Attention to Spatial Dimensions of Environmental Degradation in Parliamentary Speeches,"Over the past few decades, the public debate on environmental issues has changed from a discussion primarily focused on local environmental degradation to a discourse in which global environmental issues and those affecting the environment abroad have gained increasing levels of attention. The links between local environmental degradation and global economic dynamics have become increasingly visible. However, in political debates, some parties tend to ignore the international dimension of environmental issues, while others appear to increase their attention to this topic. Who are the parties that focus on the international dimension of environmental degradation and why? Are (traditional) economic left/right positions a meaningful predictor of parties' willingness to focus on international rather than domestic environmental issues? In this study, I map the attention to domestic and international environmental issues in parliamentary speeches and examine the factors that drive it. To this end, I employ a quantitative text analysis of speeches in the British House of Commons and the German Bundestag between 1991 and 2018. My findings indicate that the (traditional) economic left-right alignment does not influence attention to the international dimension of environmental issues, whereas the sociocultural left-right alignment does. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the party system affects the direction of the effects. In the multi-party system of Germany, socioculturally left-leaning parties speak more about international environmental issues, whereas right instead of left-leaning parties do the same in the two-party system of the United Kingdom. The findings imply that future research should take a closer look at the party system and country-specific factors when examining how parties speak about the environment in parliamentary debates.",https://osf.io/kpvjh/,2023-09-21T12:55:49.634170,[],OSF,

The target of the feedback intervention was varied between subjects: Students either received (1) feedback on metacognitive aspects, (2) feedback on motivational aspects, (3) feedback on metacognitive and motivational aspects, (4) or no feedback. Within the three feedback groups, we additionally varied feedback content from day to day within-subjects. Students either received (1) informative feedback on self-regulated learning (2) directive feedback including only a strategy suggestion, (3) transformative feedback including feedback on self-regulated learning and a strategy suggestion, (4) or – on some days – no feedback. Results revealed that informative, directive, and transformative informative feedback reduced students’ procrastination and improved daily self-monitoring, adherence to time schedules, and goal achievement compared to receiving no feedback. Informative and transformative feedback additionally improved planning strategies and concentration. Motivation and self-efficacy were unaffected by any kind of feedback. The positive effects of the intervention were most pronounced when students received feedback on metacognitive and motivational aspects. Moreover, students in the feedback groups achieved better grades in the examinations compared students in the control group. Together, results indicate that the feedback intervention effectively improved students’ self-regulated learning and achievement.

Yet, despite extensive research on politicians’ use of social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, TikTok’s distinct platform-specific languages and features have received limited attention. Its short video clips, algorithmic content recommendations, and mobile-first interface present new challenges and opportunities for politicians aiming to communicate effectively with society. This paper addresses this gap by providing a first examination of the ways in which U.S. politicians embrace and adapt to the TikTok platform. Employing a multimodal approach that studies video, text, and audio, we collect and analyse a novel dataset of TikTok videos created by U.S. Governors and Members of Congress to understand how they use comedic, documentary, communal, explanatory, interactive, and meta communication styles to connect with their audience. Our analyses reveal that U.S. politicians primarily use TikTok as a platform to communicate about political issues, often adopting explanatory and documentary styles to articulate their policies. However, the comedic style significantly boosts engagement, especially for female politicians, who see a fourfold increase in engagement when producing comedic content compared to male counterparts. This presents a challenge for politicians: balancing humor's allure with the seriousness expected from them. Our findings provide valuable insights into digital political communication on emerging platforms like TikTok and the role of multiple message modalities in harnessing online attention and engagement.",https://osf.io/g8dbu/,2023-09-21T09:18:53.671335,['umansky@ipz.uzh.ch'],OSF,

The study also aimed to explore if there were differences in perceptions of neighborhood safety between participants residing in purchased public housing and participants residing in public rental housing. Findings revealed that participants residing in public rental housing perceived their neighborhood as more dangerous than participants residing in purchased housing, which contributed to their isolation from the community. In contrast, participants from purchased housing mentioned that social cohesion and a sense of trust with their neighbors contributed to their sense of safety. Our findings suggest that close bonds and greater social cohesion among neighbors could be a possible factor to target in improving the safety perceptions of families residing in public rental housing.",https://psyarxiv.com/ek9uf/,2023-09-21T09:12:03.385579,['smtoh@childrensociety.org.sg'],OSF,

This setting permits distinguishing between irrational herding and rational self-interest—a fundamental challenge in understanding herding in strategic contexts. Moreover, participants were divided into two groups: one informed of playing against bots (informed condition) and the other unaware (uninformed condition). Our findings revealed that while informed participants adjusted their beliefs about bots' behavior, their actual decisions remained largely unaffected. In both conditions, 30% of participants followed the majority, contrary to theoretical expectations of no herding.

In this paper, we aim to improve our understanding of the IDS preference and its boundary conditions by combining and comparing these two data sources across key population and design characteristics of the underlying studies. Our analyses reveal that both the meta-analysis and multi-lab replication show moderate effect sizes (d = 0.35 for both estimates) and that both of these effects persist when relevant study-level moderators are added to the models (i.e., experimental methods, infant ages, and native languages). However, while the overall effect size estimates were similar, the two sources diverged in the effects of key moderators: both infant age and experimental method predicted IDS preference in the multi-lab replication study, but showed no effect in the meta-analysis. These results demonstrate that the IDS preference generalizes across a variety of experimental conditions and sampling characteristics, while simultaneously identifying key differences in the empirical picture offered by each source individually and pinpointing areas where substantial uncertainty remains about the influence of theoretically central moderators on IDS preference. Overall, our results show how meta-analyses and multi-lab replications can be used in tandem to understand the robustness and generalizability of developmental phenomena.",https://psyarxiv.com/etqs7/,2023-09-21T07:44:46.905862,"['Stanford University', 'martincz@princeton.edu', 'Carnegie Mellon University', 'Brigham Young University', 'Princeton University']",OSF,

This study investigated levels of drug adulteration and substitution in drugs purchased by Australians from cryptomarkets.
Methods.
Data were collected from the Dread subforum /d/Test4Pay from 1/9/2022 to 23/8/2023. Posts were included if they reported the results of drug samples submitted by post to the Vancouver-based Get Your Drugs Tested service, which uses Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with immunoassay strip tests (fentanyl and benzodiazepines).
Results.
Out of 103 samples, 65% contained only the advertised substance, 14% contained the advertised substance in combination with other psychoactive and/or potentially harmful substances, and for 21%, the advertised substance was absent. MDMA, methamphetamine and heroin were consistently found to contain only the advertised substance, while 2C-B, alprazolam and ketamine were the most likely to be completely substituted. Only one-fifth (21%) of cocaine samples contained solely the advertised substance, with 68% of the samples containing cocaine with adulterants like lidocaine, creatine, levamisole, and boric acid. No fentanyl contamination was detected. Different novel dissociatives and novel benzodiazepines were detected, as well as a nitazene compound.
Discussion and Conclusions.
Drug markets under prohibition continue to contain numerous unexpected substances, some of which can elevate risk of harm dramatically for consumers. Cryptomarkets are not immune to this problem, despite review systems which should in theory make vendors more accountable for the quality of their stock.

Little is known about how older children learn to read for the first time. Importantly, procedural learning supports children’s ability to acquire new skills implicitly and apply those skills with automaticity. Procedural learning is therefore thought to support early reading and reading-related skills, such as phonological awareness. However, as children age they may become less reliant on procedural learning. Older children learn new language skills through largely explicit memorization as opposed to implicit procedural learning, and the same is potentially true for language adjacent skills such as reading. Older children may rely less on procedurally supported phonological awareness when reading for the first time and instead rely on explicit skills such as vocabulary. We examined the role of procedural learning in emergent reading across different ages (9-15 years), focusing on low-literacy communities in rural Côte d’Ivoire, where many children remain in emergent stages of reading even at the end of primary school and age for grade is highly variable.

In this investigation, we validate 2D flood model predictions using satellite video-derived flood extents and velocities. Hydraulic simulations of a flood event with a 5-year return period (discharge of 722 m3 s-1) were conducted using HEC-RAS 2D in the Darling River at Tilpa, Australia. To extract flood extents from satellite video of the studied flood event, we use a hybrid transformer-encoder convolutional neural network (CNN)-decoder deep neural network. We evaluate the influence of test-time augmentation (TTA) – the application of transformations on test satellite video image ensembles, during deep neural network inference. We employ Large Scale Particle Image Velocimetry (LSPIV) for non-contact-based river surface velocity estimation from sequential satellite video frames. When validating hydraulic model simulations using deep neural network segmented flood extents, critical success index peaked at 94% and on average improved by 9.5% when TTA was implemented. We show that TTA offers significant value in deep neural network-based image segmentation, compensating for aleatoric uncertainties.

Background
Pigtail drainage catheters are essential tools in medical interventions that require the drainage of fluid collections from bodily cavities. Two commonly employed designs feature punched holes and skived holes. Despite the prevalence of these catheters in clinical set- tings, little research exists to compare the efficiency of the two-hole designs in terms of fluid dynamics and clinical applicability.
Objective
The primary objective of this study is to thoroughly investigate and compare the fluid dynamics characteristics and efficiency of pigtail drainage catheters with skived holes and punched holes. This study aims to quantify the effects of these hole designs on shear stress, turbulence, and volumetric flow rates, providing insight into the potential clinical implica- tions.
Methods
To achieve this, we employed a multi-modal approach incorporating both computational and experimental methods. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was employed to simulate the flow of fluid through each catheter design. This model solved the Navier-Stokes equations numerically to produce detailed velocity and pressure profiles.[1]
An experimental setup mimicking in vivo conditions was also used, where catheters with both hole types were inserted into a fluid chamber filled with a viscous fluid resembling human biological fluid.

Key Findings 
Our results indicate that catheters with skived holes demonstrate significantly lower shear stress and turbulence when compared to catheters with punched holes. Furthermore, catheters featuring skived holes achieved higher volumetric flow rates, signifying more effi- cient drainage capabilities.
Clinical Implications
The skived hole design, through its effects on fluid dynamics, appears to offer superior performance in terms of drainage efficacy. The reduced shear stress and turbulence could lead to less clogging, potentially extending the lifespan of the catheter. This has significant implications for long-term drainage scenarios, offering both cost and clinical advantages.
Conclusion
Our findings strongly suggest that the design of holes in pigtail drainage catheters plays    a crucial role in determining drainage efficacy, with skived holes offering distinct advantages in terms of fluid dynamics and overall performance. Further in-vivo studies are required to confirm these observations.",https://osf.io/f6km4/,2023-09-20T20:16:52.500044,['pstibbs@risimaging.com'],OSF,

Here we first examine to what extent different theories are commensurable (or comparable) along particular dimensions. We posit logical (and, when applicable, empirical) commensurability as a necessary condition for identifying common denominators among different theories. By consequence, dimensions for inclusion in a set of logically and empirically commensurable theories of consciousness can be proposed. Next, we compare a limited subset of neuroscience-based theories in terms of commensurability. This analysis does not yield a denominator that might serve to define a minimally unifying model of consciousness. Theories that seem to be akin by one denominator can be remote by another. We suggest a methodology of comparing different theories via multiple probing questions, allowing to discern overall (dis)similarities between theories. Despite very different background definitions of consciousness, we conclude that  it should be possible in principle to overcome the current Babylonian confusion of tongues and eventually integrate and merge different theories.",https://psyarxiv.com/z9phn/,2023-09-20T19:42:32.830739,"['Penn', 'NEU', 'MIT', 'State', 'IC', 'University of Chicago', 'Princeton University', 'SC', 'Union', 'BMC', 'IIT', 'Brown', ' State']",OSF,

In line with this trend, the current article presents a comprehensive framework that unifies bootstrap methods for LCA. The framework demonstrates various possibilities where bootstrap methods can enhance five fundamental aspects of LCA, including model selection, quantification of model selection uncertainty, detection of local dependence, parameter inference, and quantification of classification uncertainty. By integrating the bootstrap into these key aspects, this framework avoids several pitfalls one may encounter with the conventional approach and enables a more informative investigation of latent class structures within organizational research. Two Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the bootstrapped extensions of Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) in model selection, as well as the usefulness of bootstrap selection rates in capturing model selection uncertainty.

Moreover, different criteria can result in different optimal models, making it challenging to reach a consensus on the best criterion.

These techniques have been pivotal in the success of various applications, from image recognition to natural language processing. In this article, we will delve into the fundamentals of transfer learning and pre-trained models, exploring their significance and impact in the world of artificial intelligence.

The Essence of Transfer Learning
At its core, transfer learning is a machine learning technique that leverages knowledge gained from one task to improve the performance of another related task. Think of it as transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain. In traditional machine learning, models are trained from scratch for each specific task. Transfer learning, on the other hand, takes a different approach—it capitalizes on the idea that what a model learns from one task can be beneficially applied to a different but related task.

The motivation behind transfer learning is simple yet profound. Imagine training a deep neural network to recognize thousands of everyday objects, such as cats, dogs, and cars. This is a resource-intensive process that typically requires vast amounts of labeled data and significant computational power. Now, consider that you want to build a model to distinguish between different breeds of dogs, a task closely related to recognizing dogs in general. Instead of starting from scratch, you can use the knowledge the model gained from recognizing dogs to jumpstart the breed classification task. This is the essence of transfer learning.",https://osf.io/9p7jv/,2023-09-20T17:54:29.556100,"['ND', 'IC', 'Cal', 'UK', 'UT', 'SC', 'AU', 'USA', 'ENC']",OSF,

Previous studies that have investigated perceptual asymmetries for analogous auditory and visual consonant-vowel tasks have indicated a serendipitous finding: a RE advantage and a left visual field (LVF) advantage with poor cross-modal correlations. In this study we examined the possibility that this LVF for visual processing of consonant-vowel strings may be a consequence of repetition by examining perceptual biases in analogous auditory and visual tasks for both consonant-vowel strings and words. We replicated opposite perceptual biases for consonant-vowel strings (RE and LVF advantages). This did not extend to word stimuli where we found RE and RVF advantages. Furthermore, these perceptual biases did not differ across three experimental blocks. Thus, we can firmly conclude that this LVF is unique to consonant-vowel strings and is not a consequence of the repetition of a relatively limited number of stimuli. Finally, a test of covariances indicated cross-modal relationships between laterality indices suggesting that perceptual biases are dissociable within individuals and cluster on mode of presentation (auditory vs. visual).",https://psyarxiv.com/jb4v3/,2023-09-20T17:10:01.028345,"['adam_parker@ucl.ac.uk', 'Bona', 'WC', 'UC']",OSF,

Although HFAs have minimal impact on ozone depletion, their global warming potential (GWP) is more than 1,000 times higher than CO2, bringing them in scope for restriction under the F-Gas Regulation in the European Union (EU). The pharmaceutical industry is developing solutions, including a near-zero GWP ‘next-generation propellant,’ HFO-1234ze(E). At the same time, the EU is also evaluating a restriction on per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation.

Traditional public engagement methods are often face-to-face, such as town halls, public forums, and workshops. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these approaches were rendered ineffective due to health risks and the engagement process saw a shift towards virtual meetings. While accessible to a broader audience, virtual public meetings introduced challenges around limited time and opportunity for attendees to share feedback. Furthermore, attendees were often required to identify themselves, potentially discouraging reticent attendees from speaking up and risking confrontations with other attendees. To mitigate this issue, we designed and developed CommunityClick-Virtual, a multi-modal companion web application that allows virtual meeting participants to provide feedback on meeting discussions silently and anonymously using six customizable options or through chat messages without the need to speak up.
The organizers have access to all attendee feedback channels where they can use synchronized coordinated visualizations to gather a more holistic understanding of people's perspectives. The field deployments of CommunityClick-Virtual demonstrated its efficacy in increasing participation and enabling organizers to identify insights that could help them make more informed decisions.

Without optical correction, all adults will suffer from blurry close vision starting in their 40s. In effect, different optical corrections are necessary for near and far vision. Current state-of-the-art glasses offer a gradual change of correction across the field of view for any distance—using Progressive Addition Lenses (PALs). However, an inevitable side effect of PALs is geometric distortion, which causes the swim effect, a phenomenon of unstable perception of the environment leading to discomfort for many wearers. Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between lens distortions and their perceptual effects, that is, between the complex physical distortions on the one hand and their subjective severity on the other.
We show that perceived distortion can be measured as a psychophysical scaling function using a VR experiment with accurately simulated PAL distortions. Despite the multi-dimensional space of physical distortions, the measured perception is well represented as a 1D scaling function; distortions are perceived less with negative far correction, suggesting an advantage for short-sighted people.
Beyond that, our results successfully demonstrate that psychophysical scaling with ordinal embedding methods can investigate complex perceptual phenomena like lens distortions that affect geometry, stereo, and motion perception. Our approach provides a new perspective on lens design based on modeling visual processing that could be applied beyond distortions. We anticipate that future PAL designs could be improved using our method to minimize subjectively discomforting distortions rather than merely optimizing physical parameters.",https://psyarxiv.com/pge5n/,2023-09-20T14:24:34.686158,[],OSF,

patients reacted significantly slower than control patients across all memory conditions. 2x3

It makes evident that staple crops, vital for calorie intake, cannot be economically grown in VF. Nonetheless, leafy vegetables can and are grown in VF. Based on existing literature, we quantify VF's annual production potential and its associated electricity consumption. We use figures about electricity production to demonstrate that it is doubtful that urban VF production is more climate-smart than transport from far away. It is indeed wishful thinking that there is no environmental cost to getting rid of (free and non-polluting) sun light, even for the very best lighting fixtures. Even in a future world of green (but not unlimited) electricity, there will be a need for balancing grid usage, which does not fit well with the electricity craving of VFs. While VF significantly reduces water use and avoids chemical emissions, these benefits can also be attained in greenhouses, and they often fail to outweigh the environmental impact of electricity consumption. VF may have potential for niche crop production, or be employed for other practical reasons.

Self-control as the ability to manage desires and impulses, is a complex and remarkable construct, particularly in coping with every day challenges. The importance of self-control in regulating one’s action, emotion and cognition, has sparked interest in developing training programs. The present study adopted the Process Model of self-control to develop a video game called ""Slankers"" aimed at enhancing various aspects of self-control.
Methods
Seventy participants (aged 18-35 years) were randomly assigned to the intervention and active control groups. The intervention group received Slankers game over ten sessions for two weeks, while the active control group engaged in equal number of mathematics problem-solving sessions. Participants were assessed using the Stroop test, the Kirby delay discounting questionnaire, the Barratt impulsiveness scale, and the 36-item Tangney Self-control scale, at baseline and at the end of the interventions using the Gorilla online platform. Data were analyzed using the Python programming language.
Results
The results showed significant effects of group (F = 3.24, p &lt; 0.001), time (F = 30.09, p &lt; 0.001), and their interaction (F = 36.57, p &lt; 0.001) on the Stroop interference effect. Game training significantly improved participant’s performance in the Stroop test. Moreover, Tangney self-control score increased due to time (F = 6.14, p = 0.01) and its interaction with group (F = 9.43, p = 0.003), whereas Delay discounting decreased over time (F = 4.05, p = 0.04) for both groups. Feasibility and acceptability data demonstrate that 97.14% of participants completed all training sessions and rated the clarity of instructions as 0.95 out of 1, game attractiveness as 0.94 out of 1, and the inclination to recommend the game to peers as 0.94 out of 1. 
Conclusions
Slankers shows potential in improving various aspects of self-control. Our primary results are consistent with prior research supporting the avenue of the video game training on measures of self-control. The acceptability and feasibility findings as well as the positive effects on subjective and cognitive aspects of self-control, show promises for capitalizing on the Slankers in the future studies.",https://psyarxiv.com/xk6ca/,2023-09-20T13:25:38.531546,"['IC', 'rezapour_t@icss.ac.ir']",OSF,

Our results identified ten promotive factors based on the main effects on Grade 6 arithmetic skill when Grade 1 arithmetic skill was controlled for: better skills in number counting, spatial relations, RAN, and nonverbal reasoning, as well as higher self-concept in math, higher task value for math, more persistence in homework, less parental support with homework, no parental math difficulties, and higher socioeconomic status. In addition, four protective factors were identified based on significant interactions with Grade 1 arithmetic skill (risk factor) and the signaling of gap-closing effects in arithmetic skills: number concepts, oral language, nonverbal reasoning, and gender. Parental support in math homework also showed a significant interaction effect, but it was not consistent with the classic protective factor model. Overall, the study offers a framework for resilience research in arithmetic and draws attention to the promotive and protective factors that support arithmetic development.",https://psyarxiv.com/ydrcp/,2023-09-20T13:00:45.454096,"['RIT', 'IC', 'ENC', 'maria.m.psyridou@jyu.fi']",OSF,

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) is often used to repeatedly assess momentary wellbeing and to compute wellbeing dynamics in daily life. However, it is also possible to analyze wellbeing dynamics over extended periods using retrospective longitudinal survey data. To gain deeper insights into individual differences in wellbeing dynamics, we conducted a comparative analysis of wellbeing dynamics based on EMA data and longitudinal survey data. 
We combined longitudinal survey data (N=15,323) and EMA data (N=817) from adult twins of the Netherlands Twin Register. Using regression models and twin models, we investigated the relation between general wellbeing and wellbeing dynamics (i.e., mean, variability, and stability) and the heritability of wellbeing dynamics at the different time scales. 
In longitudinal survey data, individuals with higher general wellbeing showed lower variability. In EMA data, only average momentary affect was related to general wellbeing, but not affect variability. Additionally, we report that genetic influences play a role in individual differences in wellbeing variability in longitudinal survey data (h2=12%, 95%CI:.08, .17). In the EMA data, the variability of positive affect showed a significant heritability as well (h2=38%, 95%CI:.21, .51), whereas negative affect variability and both positive and negative affect stability was mostly influenced by the unique environment (78-100%).
Comparing longitudinal survey and EMA data, we showed different results for wellbeing dynamics across years and moments.

Thus, identifying predictors that shape the course of post-discharge NSSI may provide insights into ways to improve clinical outcomes. Accordingly, we used machine learning to identify the strongest predictors of NSSI trajectories drawn from a comprehensive clinical assessment. Method: The study included adolescents (N=612; females n=435; 71.1%) aged 13-19-years-old (M=15.6, SD=1.4) receiving treatment from a psychiatric inpatient service. Youth were administered clinical interviews and symptom questionnaires at treatment initiation (baseline) and before termination. NSSI frequency was assessed at one-, three-, and six-month follow-ups. Latent class growth analyses were used to group adolescents based on their pattern of NSSI engagement across follow-ups. Results: Three classes were identified, reflecting: Low Stable (n=83), Moderate Fluctuating (n=260), and High Persistent (n=269). Important predictors of the High Persistent class in our regularized regression models (LASSO) included baseline psychiatric symptoms and comorbidity, past-week suicidal ideation (SI) severity, lifetime average and worst-point SI intensity, and NSSI in the past 30 days (bs=0.75-2.33). Only worst-point lifetime suicide ideation intensity was identified as a predictor of the Low Stable class (b=-8.82); no predictors of Moderate Fluctuating class were identified. Conclusion: This study identified a set of intake clinical variables that indicate which adolescents may experience persistent NSSI post-discharge.

We found that using features generated by OpenFace provides a better solution in the case of smiles, whereas using simple end-to-end architectures proved to be much more helpful in the case of looking behavior.

Any national or global metric of mental wellbeing therefore needs to reflect not only how people are feeling, but also how well they are functioning in life across a range of cognitive, social, emotional and physical dimensions. However, existing metrics typically focus on either negative symptoms or conversely, feelings of happiness or life satisfaction, rather than functioning, or indirectly infer wellbeing from a selection of social and economic factors. Here we present the Mental Health Quotient, or MHQ, a metric of mental wellbeing that comprehensively captures both feeling and functioning, and that is based on this WHO definition. We describe the 47-item assessment and the life impact rating scale on which the MHQ metric is based, as well as the rationale behind each step of the nonlinear algorithm used to construct the MHQ metric. We then demonstrate that this results in a linear relationship between the MHQ metric and productive life function where movement on the scale from any point or in any direction relates to an equivalent shift in productive ability at the population level, a relationship that is not borne out using simple sum scores. We further show that this relationship is the same across all age groups. Finally, we demonstrate the potential for the types of insights that the MHQ metric can provide, offering examples from the Global Mind Project, an initiative that aims to track and understand our evolving mental wellbeing, and since 2020 has collected responses from over 1 million individuals across 140+ countries.",https://osf.io/d47qj/,2023-09-20T07:57:55.925265,"['State', 'jennifer@sapienlabs.orgMHQ', 'USA', ' State']",OSF,

Moreover, an item´s salience in the news media before the survey data collection and whether an item measures attitudes toward individual financial and non-financial costs are significantly associated with higher opinion polarization.

How much of that information can a reader process at once? Previous studies demonstrated that low-level visual features of multiple words are processed in parallel, but lexical attributes are processed serially, for one word at a time. This implies that an internal bottleneck lies somewhere between early visual and lexical analysis. We used a dual- task behavioral paradigm to investigate whether this bottleneck lies at the stage of letter recognition or phonological decoding. On each trial, two letter strings were flashed briefly, one above and one below fixation, and then masked. In the letter identification experiment, participants indicated whether a vowel was present in a particular letter string. In the phonological decoding experiment, participants indicated whether the letter string was pronounceable. We compared accuracy in a focused attention condition, in which participants judged only one of the two strings, with accuracy in a divided attention condition, in which participants judged both strings independently. In both experiments, the cost of dividing attention was so large that it supported a serial model: participants were able to process only one letter string per trial. Furthermore, we found a stimulus processing tradeoff that is characteristic of serial processing: when participants judged one string correctly, they were less likely to judge the other string correctly. Therefore, the bottleneck that constrains word recognition under these conditions arises at a sub-lexical level, perhaps due to a limit on the efficiency of letter recognition.",https://psyarxiv.com/f6rmp/,2023-09-20T02:44:11.281567,"['alwhite@barnard.edu', 'Columbia University']",OSF,

Here, we attempt to close this gap between by highlighting recent work that demonstrates shared neuroanatomical and neurophysiological signatures of inhibitory control across domains. We propose that the regulation of thalamocortical drive by a fronto-subthalamic mechanism operating in the β-band might be a domain-general mechanism for inhibitory control in the human brain.",https://psyarxiv.com/vrkyd/,2023-09-20T00:17:59.302062,"['GU', 'Penn', 'NEU', 'ND', 'University of Iowa', 'Williams', 'State', 'UK', 'SC', 'San Francisco ', 'USA', ' State', 'jan-wessel@uiowa.edu']",OSF,

A total of 108 studies met our inclusion criteria, with the majority (79 studies) involving vertebrate animal models and 29 studies focusing on human subjects. Animal models included zebrafish, mice, rats, sheep, and non-human primates, investigating the impact of ethanol on cerebellar structure, gene/protein expression, physiology, and cerebellar-dependent behaviors. Additionally, some animal studies explored potential therapeutic interventions against ethanol-induced cerebellar damage. The human studies predominantly adopted cohort designs, exploring the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on cerebellar structure and function. Certain human studies delved into innovative cerebellar-based diagnostic approaches for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The collective findings from these studies clearly indicate that the cerebellum is involved in various neurophysiological deficits associated with FASD, emphasizing the importance of evaluating both cerebellar structure and function in the diagnostic process for this condition.

An intriguing hypothesis is that words actively acquired via pragmatic inference (as opposed to simpler and more direct word-to-world mapping) might be better retained over time. On this hypothesis, to the extent that socio-cognitive skills support pragmatic computation, such socio-cognitive skills should also support inferentially-driven word learning outcomes. In the current study, we compared adults’ immediate attainment and later retention of novel word meanings acquired through either direct mapping or pragmatic inference. We found that pragmatic inference facilitated the retention of novel words compared to direct mapping (Experiment 1). Moreover, better socio-cognitive skills, measured by the Mind-in-the-Eyes task, were associated with better retention specifically for meanings that were inferred but not for meanings acquired through direct mapping (Experiment 1). Furthermore, when social cognition was taxed before word learning, the advantage of pragmatic inference for meaning retention in the same paradigm was diminished (Experiment 2).

People can employ intentional strategies to prevent conscious intrusions of negative memories, and repeated attempts to stop retrieval both reduces the frequency of intrusions and improves subsequent emotions elicited by those memories. However, it is still unknown whether memory control can improve negative emotions immediately, at the time control is attempted. It is also not clear which strategy is most beneficial for emotion regulation; clearing the mind of any thoughts of negative memories via direct suppression, or substituting memory recall with alternative thoughts. Here, we provide novel evidence that memory control immediately regulates negative emotions associated with autobiographical memories of morally wrong actions.  Repeated control significantly improved negative emotions over time, regardless of the strategy used to implement control. Thought substitution involving either positive diversionary thinking or counterfactual thinking both induced positive feelings, whereas direct suppression neutralised emotions, regardless of whether memories were positive or negative. These empirical findings have implications for clinical practice as they indicate that memory control strategies could be effective emotion regulation methods for real-world intrusive memories.",https://psyarxiv.com/v3emd/,2023-09-19T22:31:19.037578,['UK'],OSF,

Sensitivity to facial configuration has long been considered a marker of human perceptual expertise for faces. We tested whether DCNNs trained for face identification ""perceive"" alterations to facial features and their configuration. We also compared the extent to which representations changed as a function of the alteration type. Facial configuration was altered by changing the distance between the eyes or the distance between the nose and mouth. Face features were altered by replacing the eyes or mouth with those of another face. Altered faces were processed by DCNNs (Ranjan et al., 2017; Szegedy et al., 2017) and the similarity of the generated representations was compared. Both DCNNs were sensitive to configural and feature changes --- with changes to configuration altering the DCNN representations more than changes to face features. To determine whether the DCNNs' greater sensitivity to configuration was due to a priori differences in the images or characteristics of the DCNN processing, we compared the representation of features and configuration between the low-level, pixel-based representation and the DCNN-generated representations. Sensitivity to face configuration increased from the pixel-level image to the DCNN encoding, whereas the sensitivity to features did not change. The enhancement of configural information may be due to the utility of configuration for discriminating among similar faces and the within-category nature of face identification training.",https://psyarxiv.com/xu4sm/,2023-09-19T20:35:33.474597,"['University of Texas', 'GU', 'The University of Texas at Dallas', 'The University of Texas', 'The U', 'University of Texas at Dallas', 'DC']",OSF,

Drawing on the morals and markets tradition from economic sociology and the deservingness scholarship from cultural sociology, I use an original conjoint survey experiment on a national sample of Americans (N = 1,983) to answer the question: ""What type of buyer do Americans believe is the fairest to sell a house to?"" The findings reveal a surprising divergence from market fundamentalism. Americans, regardless of political affiliation, believe it is fairer to sell to fellow citizens intending to use the home as their primary residence over the highest bidder. Open-ended responses find that concerns about investors pricing out ordinary Americans outweigh potential financial gain, highlighting buyer deservingness, previously overlooked by
sociologists, as a central component of market fairness. These results identify a stark misalignment between Americans’ moral values and the current reality of the housing market, providing theoretical and empirical insights for scholars studying morals and markets, housing, and inequality.",https://osf.io/47ux9/,2023-09-19T18:41:33.579577,"['Stanford University', ' State', 'State', 'angelahe@stanford.edu']",OSF,

Additionally, limited research has examined possible differential effects of “major” discrimination and microaggression experiences in everyday life on alcohol craving. This between-groups experiment examined causal effects of everyday racial discrimination on stress, negative emotions, and alcohol craving. We also tested indirect pathways by which discrimination-related experiences were linked to alcohol craving via stress and negative emotions. Method: People of color and Indigenous peoples participated in the study (N=184; Mage=23.90; 47.8% women; 48.9% community adults). Participants were randomized to one of four experimental conditions, in which they experienced in virtual environments either “major” discrimination, microinsult, microinvalidation, or daily hassles unrelated to race/racism. Participants’ levels of stress, negative emotions, and alcohol craving were assessed immediately before and after experimental simulations. Results: Compared to daily hassles unrelated to race/racism, simulated racial discrimination elicited greater stress and negative emotions. Daily hassles caused greater alcohol craving among those who endorsed higher levels of coping motives for drinking. We observed minimal differences in stress and negative emotions across the three racial discrimination conditions, and found no evidence supporting indirect links between racial discrimination and alcohol craving via stress and negative emotions. Conclusion: Everyday racial discrimination—regardless of intensity level—is more stressful than daily hassles unrelated to race/racism.

Specifically, for every increased breath per minute, the odds of experiencing moderate-to-high stress were 1.25 times higher (a 25% increase), holding demographic and psychological history variables constant. Notably, relationships with stress were specific to respiratory rate, but were not found with other sleep measures previously linked to stress, such as heart rate variability, total sleep hours, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and wake up count.

Emotions might be of particular significance in civic education, where oftentimes highly controversial and heated debates take place. We examined antecedents and effects of classroom emotions in civic education through the lens of the control-value theory, where emotions are categorized in terms of valence (positive/negative) and arousal (activating/deactivating). Specifically, we investigated the classroom climate during discussions of political and social issues as an antecedent of students’ enjoyment, shame, anxiety, and boredom, in addition to a possible mediation effect of these emotions on political knowledge and participation as core outcomes in this domain. We tested our assumptions based on data from 1,117 students at vocational schools (grades 10–13). Multilevel structural equation modeling revealed different results based on the valence of emotions, showing a positive relation between an open classroom climate and enjoyment and negative relations with anxiety and boredom. No support was provided for the relation to shame. Enjoyment related positively, and all negative emotions (shame, anxiety, boredom) negatively to achievement on the knowledge test. In terms of arousal, all activating emotions (enjoyment, shame, anxiety) related positively to intended political participation. Furthermore, enjoyment mediated the association between classroom climate and intended political participation at the student level. Thus, this study strongly supports the theoretical assumptions of the control-value theory. Pedagogically, the results imply that fostering a classroom context that is open to diverse opinions can prevent the experience of negative emotions and increase students’ experience of enjoyment.",https://psyarxiv.com/y8jpv/,2023-09-19T16:02:15.740223,"['MU', 'ND', 'UC', 'UL', 'graf.elisabeth@univie.ac.at', 'UCA', 'IC']",OSF,

Background: Catastrophizing is a transdiagnostic construct that has been suggested to precipitate and maintain a multiplicity of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, PTSD and OCD. However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms that result in catastrophizing are unknown. Relating reinforcement learning model parameters to catastrophizing may allow us to further understand the process of catastrophizing.
Objective: Using a modified four-armed bandit task, we aimed to investigate the relationship between reinforcement learning parameters and self-report catastrophizing questionnaire scores to gain a mechanistic understanding of how catastrophizing may alter learning. 
Methods: We recruited 211 participants to complete a computerised four-armed bandit task and tested the fit of six reinforcement learning models on our data, including two novel models which both incorporated a scaling factor related to a history of negative outcomes variable. We investigated the relationship between self-report catastrophizing scores and free parameters from the overall best-fitting model, along with the best-fitting model to include history, using Pearson’s correlations. Subsequently, we reassessed these relationships using multiple regression analyses to evaluate whether any observed relationships were altered when relevant IQ and mental health covariates were applied. 
Results: Model-agnostic analyses indicated there were effects of outcome history on reaction time and accuracy, and that the effects on accuracy related to catastrophizing. The overall model of best fit was the Standard Rescorla-Wagner Model and the best-fitting model to include history was a model in which learning rate was scaled by history of negative outcome. We found no effect of catastrophizing on the scaling by history of negative outcome parameter (r=0.003, p=0.679), the learning rate parameter (r=0.026, p=0.703) or the inverse temperature parameter (r=0.086, p=0.220).       
Conclusion: We were unable to relate catastrophizing to any of the reinforcement learning parameters we investigated. This implies that catastrophizing is not straightforwardly linked to any changes to learning after a series of negative outcomes are received. Future research could use further exploration of the space of models which include a history parameter.",https://psyarxiv.com/gh2fp/,2023-09-19T15:57:27.386694,"['Penn', 'UC', 'Midd', 'MIT', 'Williams', 'State', 'NU', 'SC', 'Penn State', 'OC', 'ENC', 'SU', 'ODU', 'CU', 'ND', 'SCU', 'IC', 'UT', 'ESU', 'UL', 'PTS', 'Brown', ' State', 'WC']",OSF,

Although infant research has demonstrated the association between environmental experiences, cognitive outcomes, and resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG), it remains unknown how these experiences impact neural and cognitive development throughout the school years. To address this gap, we applied a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to rsEEG data to identify which neural frequencies at rest are most strongly associated with unique aspects of socioeconomic status (SES; income and maternal education) and cognitive (vocabulary, working memory) outcomes among school-aged children (8-15 years). We find that changes in the alpha frequency are associated with SES globally, while gamma1 and theta fluctuations are tied to dissociable aspects of SES and cognitive outcomes. Specifically, changes in the gamma frequency are predictive of both maternal education and vocabulary outcome, while changes in the theta frequency are related to both income and working memory ability.

Here, we will use online testing in a registered report to investigate whether rewards tend to retroactively enhance certain types of memories. Consistent with prior research and theories involving how dopamine modulates the hippocampus, we hypothesize that reward retroactively enhances memory in a delay-dependent manner, emerging only after a period of consolidation. Crucially, we further predict that this long-delay modulation of memory will be stronger for associative memory than for item recognition—a factor not previously considered despite its clear theoretical grounding.

To understand the extent to which various demographic and social determinants predict mental wellbeing status and their relative hierarchy of predictive power in order to prioritize and develop population-based preventative approaches.
Design:
Cross-sectional analysis of survey data.
Setting:
Internet based survey from 32 countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Middle East and North Africa, Sub Saharan Africa, South Asia and Australia.
Participants:
270,000 adults aged 18-85+ who participated in the Mental Health Million project.
Primary and secondary outcome measures:
We utilized 120+ demographic and social determinants to predict the aggregate mental health score of individuals (MHQ) and determine their relative predictive influence using various types of machine learning models including random forest, gradient boosting and logistic regression. The MHQ is derived from self-ratings of 47 mental health elements spanning ten disorders and provides a score that positions individuals along a spectrum from negative to positive mental health status that aligns with life impact and function criterion.
Results:
Classification models correctly identified 80% of those with a negative MHQ, while regression models predicted the specific MHQ score within ±15% of the position on the scale. Factors with the biggest predictive impact were young age followed by frequency of social interaction with friends, frequency of good sleep and physical exercise, and number of traumatic experiences. Age had twice the predictive power of social interaction which, in turn, was twice as important as the next four most important factors. Other predictive factors included sexual abuse, cyberbullying, and use of sleeping pills and sedatives.
Conclusion:
Social determinants of traumas and adversities and lifestyle can account for 60-70% of mental health challenges. However, additional factors are at play, particularly in younger age groups that are not included in this data and need further investigation.",https://osf.io/k8h3u/,2023-09-19T12:18:19.764942,"['USA', ' State', 'jerzy@sapienlabs.org', 'jennifer@sapienlabs.org', 'State']",OSF,

These measures should have high acquisition rates and good face and construct validity. Here, we investigated the feasibility of a naturalistic electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm in a low-resource context during childhood. Additionally, we examined the sensitivity of periodic and aperiodic EEG metrics to social and non-social stimuli. 
We recorded simultaneous 20-channel EEG and eye-tracking in 72 children aged 4-12 years (45 females) while they watched videos of women singing nursery rhymes and moving toys, selected to represent familiar childhood experiences. These measures were part of feasibility study that assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a follow-up data collection of the South African Safe Passage Study, which tracks environmental adversity and brain and cognitive development from before birth up until childhood. We examined whether data quantity and quality varied with child characteristics, and the sensitivity of varying EEG metrics (canonical band power in the theta and alpha band and periodic and aperiodic features of the power spectra). 
We found that children who completed the EEG and eye-tracking assessment were, in general, representative of the full cohort. Data quantity was higher in children with greater visual attention to the stimuli. Out of the tested EEG metrics, periodic measures in the theta frequency range were most sensitive to condition differences compared to alpha range measures and canonical and aperiodic EEG measures. 
Our results show that measuring EEG during ecologically valid social and non-social stimuli is feasible in low resource settings, is feasible to most children and produces robust indices of social brain function.

However, there is inconsistent evidence regarding whether MBPs improve work performance, and if so, whether MBPs outperform other alternative interventions. 

This randomised controlled feasibility trial assessed procedural uncertainties including recruitment and retention and aimed to estimate the likely effect size of a self-guided online MBP on work performance, relative to an alternative intervention, to inform sample size calculation for a later-stage trial. 

Two hundred and forty-one employees from 8 employers were randomised (1:1 allocation) to complete a four-week, self-guided, online delivered intervention of either the Be Mindful MBP or a light physical exercise programme (an active control intervention). The primary outcome was self-reported work performance at post-intervention measured using the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included depression, anxiety, stress, and cognitive processes hypothesised to be targeted by the MBP, including decentering and cognitive control. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 12-week follow-up. The trial protocol was pre-registered (NCT04631302) and published.

Eighty-seven percent of randomised participants started the course. The acceptability of both courses was high with typical retention rates for outcome measure collection (64% at post-intervention and 30% at follow-up). We found that the MBP, compared to the control, offered negligible benefits for work performance at post-intervention (d = 0.06) and 12-week follow-up (d = 0.02). We observed small effect sizes (ds = -0.09-0.04) for the difference between the MBP and the control for mental health and cognitive control secondary outcomes. Both interventions improved mental health outcomes from pre- to post-intervention (ds = -0.40-0.58, p &lt; 0.001).

Results provide little support for a later-phase trial comparing an MBP to a light exercise control. We summarise procedural challenges to inform future trials of online MBPs at work. Results suggest MBPs are unlikely to improve work performance relative to an active control. Although the MBP improved mental health outcomes, other active interventions such as light physical exercise may be just as efficacious.",https://psyarxiv.com/wamkn/,2023-09-19T11:57:11.899495,['UK'],OSF,

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is the most widely used depression screener but debate still remains around its relationship to symptom experience and life impact.
Methods:
Using a sample of 5,750 respondents, we compared symptom frequency measured by PHQ-9, to ratings of life impact and the breadth of symptomatic experience measured by the Mental Health Quotient (MHQ), a transdiagnostic assessment of mental health that captures symptoms across 10 mental health disorders on a 9-point life impact scale and includes items that map to the PHQ-9.
Results:
Frequency and life impact of individual symptoms were significantly correlated. However, there was substantial variability of life impact within each frequency category, and mean life impact for the same frequency varied significantly across symptoms. In the aggregate, only 47.7% of those with PHQ-9 “severe” scores (sum score ≥20) met the most severe life impact threshold while 53.3% had average life impact ratings that aligned with a value corresponding to ‘OK’ or one point worse than ‘OK’ on the 9-point scale. Finally, individuals with “severe” depression measured by the PHQ-9 had numerous additional symptoms of high life impact, as well as highly heterogeneous life impact profiles across symptoms both assessed and not assessed by the PHQ-9 (Coefficient of variation of 119% and 122% for differences across individuals).
Conclusions:
The findings demonstrate that “severe” depression as determined by PHQ-9 frequency ratings is highly permissive in the context of functional life impact which may be a more meaningful metric for the individual. In addition, these individuals experience many and varied symptoms of equivalent or greater life impact beyond those captured by the PHQ-9 and have highly heterogeneous symptom profiles both within and beyond PHQ-9 symptoms. Consequently, those with “severe” depression as assessed by the PHQ-9 cannot be considered a symptomatically consistent or homogeneous group. Thus, assessments which capture a broader, transdiagnostic range of symptoms and their life impact could aid in more precise symptom profiling and treatment pathways.",https://osf.io/p7q8x/,2023-09-19T12:02:01.737765,"['jennifer@sapienlabs.orgPHQ', 'State', 'USA', ' State']",OSF,

It argues that austerity policies politicised grievances and enabled blame attribution, while institutional constraints and protest fatigue dampened reactions to later policies. Using monthly protest event data and systematically coded austerity policy announcements, the study utilises an interrupted time series design to analyse austerity announcements as shocks to protest levels. The findings indicate that earlier austerity announcements significantly increased economic protest levels, while later announcements had no effect or even decreased protest. Furthermore, the impact of austerity on protest was conditioned by economic and political contexts. Austerity had a larger effect when accompanied by rising unemployment, worsening household finances, external actor involvement, and higher prior protest levels. The study contributes to understanding varied public reactions to austerity and the dynamics between economic crisis, government policies, and contentious politics.",https://osf.io/93tz4/,2023-09-19T11:29:31.995061,['chendi.wang@vu.nl'],OSF,

Yet, the economic success of these policies varied significantly. This raises the question of whether and under what conditions austerity is an effective policy strategy to restore economic stability. This study shows that the impact of austerity on economic confidence is conditioned by an important political factor, namely the electoral strength of the government. Our macro-level time series analysis tracks the impact of austerity announcements on economic conﬁdence over time in 15 European countries during the Great Recession, showing that austerity leads to a decrease in economic confidence. However, the negative impact is substantially smaller when austerity is announced by an electorally strong government vis-à-vis a fragile one. Our individual-level survey experiment with a total of 7,500 respondents in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain indicates that the negative effects of spending cuts on both pocketbook and sociotropic concerns are particularly pronounced when austerity policies are announced by governments that are losing electoral support.

We define the social goals in the model via the mechanism of avoiding a conflict of beliefs in common ground. We offer a Rational Speech Act formalism and introduce the Alignment Model of Indirectness (AMI). In this model, indirectness acts as a common ground management tool that allows the speaker to probe the state of common ground before committing to particular beliefs publicly.

Simulated gambling products, like loot boxes and social casino games, contain gambling elements, but are not classified as gambling. They are available to minors, raising concerns about a “gateway effect” into gambling. This study examined the time course of young people’s engagement in simulated and monetary gambling, and associations between simulated gambling and gambling problems and harm. A necessary, although not sufficient, condition for simulated games leading to real money gambling is that simulated play must come first. 

Method
Participants were 1,026 young adults (aged 18-25 years) who played video games in the last year. They reported the age at which they first took part in seven simulated and twelve monetary gambling products, and current gambling problems and harm.

Results
First use of loot boxes and video games with gambling content tended to precede monetary gambling. Forms where gambling is a core gameplay element, such as social casino and demonstration games, tended to follow some monetary gambling forms. Engagement in most simulated gambling products was associated with greater harm from monetary gambling.

Discussion
The findings leave open the possibility of a catalyst pathway from youth engagement in loot boxes and games with gambling content to later monetary gambling, but causal psychosocial mechanisms remain unclear. However, a pathway from social casino and demonstration games to monetary gambling appears less likely, which may instead reflect containment or substitution effects.

Occupational violence (OV) towards healthcare staff often results in unrealised negative impacts on healthcare workers, patients, and the healthcare system. Hence, occupational violence prevention has become a priority in healthcare settings. Successful implementation of an occupational violence prevention program depends on the acceptability and suitability of the program to the healthcare staff. The discrete choice experiment (DCE) method has been widely used to elicit preferences for different aspects of healthcare services. The present study aims to understand the key attributes of security models of care for an occupational violence prevention program to select attributes for a future DCE survey.

Methods
A multi-stage approach was used to generate the key attributes for an occupational violence prevention program. Focus group discussions were conducted with staff at a major metropolitan hospital in Queensland, Australia, during May and June 2022, where the pilot program - an occupational violence prevention program using specialised security personnel known as Ambassador- was implemented. The identified attributes were then refined through an expert panel discussion. 

Results
Two experienced qualitative researchers facilitated four focus group discussions. The focus group participants (n=14) included the Queensland Occupational Violence Strategy Unit team members responsible for implementing the program, healthcare staff, Ambassadors, and security personnel. The expert panel, comprising occupational violence researchers, health economists, and health service researchers (n=6), refined the six potential attributes of the focus groups. The final attribute list included skills, uniform, coverage, security availability, training and being embedded in the clinical team, each with up to three levels.

Conclusion 
Attributes identified from this study will be used in future DCE studies to elicit healthcare staff preferences for occupational violence prevention programs using security models of care. The DCE study will strengthen the design and implementation of occupational violence prevention programs to best address the needs of healthcare staff.",https://osf.io/9xzmv/,2023-09-19T07:10:46.888754,"['GU', 'BW', 'r.hettiarachchi@uq.edu.au', 'The U', 'DC', 'IC', 'NU', 'BMC', 'USA', 'Duke']",OSF,

Principal comparisons are between firearm owners and nonowners without firearms at home; secondary comparisons among owners are based on type(s) of firearm owned, recency of latest purchase (2020 or later, 2019 or earlier), and frequency of firearm carrying outside the home.
Results: The analytic sample comprised 12,851 respondents: 5820 (45.3%) firearm owners, 6132 (47.7%) nonowners without firearms at home, and 899 (7.0%) nonowners with firearms at home. After weighting, half of the respondents (51.0%, 95% CI 49.9%, 52.1%) were female; 62.6% (95% CI 61.5%, 63.8%) were white, non-Hispanic; mean (SD) age was 48.5 (18.0) years. Owners were more likely than nonowners without firearms at home to consider violence usually or always justified to advance at least 1 of 17 specific political objectives (owners: 38.8%; 95% CI, 37.3%, 40.4%; nonowners without firearms at home: 29.8%; 95% CI, 28.5%, 31.2%). For some individual objectives, nonowners without firearms at home justified violence more frequently than owners did. Owners were generally not more willing than nonowners without firearms at home to engage directly in political violence. Recent purchasers, always/nearly always carriers, and to a lesser extent owners of assault-type rifles were more supportive than other firearm owners of political violence and more willing to engage in it. 
Conclusions and Relevance: Differences between firearm owners as a whole and nonowners without firearms at home were small to moderate when present and were often absent. Results for several subsets of owners suggest an increased risk for participation in political violence. The findings of this study should help guide efforts to prevent political violence.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h7ksv/,2023-09-21T08:50:54.143319,"['California', 'UC', ' State', 'UC Davis', 'gjwintemute@ucdavis.edu', 'State', 'Cal']",OSF,

Using this approach, faces-selective saccades have been observed within 100 ms post-stimulus. When taking into account oculomotor processing, this suggests that faces can be detected in as little as 70-80 ms. It has therefore been suggested that face detection must occur during the initial feedforward sweep, since this latency leaves little time for feedback processing. In the current experiment, we tested this hypothesis using backward masking – a technique shown to primarily disrupt feedback processing while leaving feedforward activation relatively intact. Based on minimum saccadic reaction time (SRT), we found that face detection benefitted from ultra-fast, accurate saccades within 110-160 ms and that these eye movements are obtainable even under extreme masking conditions that limit perceptual awareness. However, masking did significantly increase the median SRT for faces. In the manual responses, we found remarkable detection accuracy for faces and houses, even when participants indicated having no visual experience of the test images. These results provide evidence for the view that the saccadic bias to faces is initiated by coarse information used to categorize faces in the feedforward sweep, but that, in most cases, additional processing is required to quickly reach the threshold for saccade initiation.",https://psyarxiv.com/z9tcq/,2023-09-18T21:10:11.735040,"['Boston University', 'alison.candice.campbell@gmail.com', 'jtanaka@uvic.ca', 'BC']",OSF,

Informed by sociology and cultural psychology, we treat social classes as group contexts characterized by the interplay of material, social, and cultural capital. Subjecting three datasets to latent profile analysis (LPA; N = 30,332), we uncover qualitatively distinct class groupings within the U.S. population—each characterized by a unique pattern of capital (Studies 1–3). Consistent with theory in cultural psychology, class formation is guided by a reciprocal relationship between material capital (income and assets) and social capital (interpersonal ties). Across studies, we predict and observe one profile (the “middle/upper class”) that exhibits high material capital but low levels of social capital, and another profile (the “vulnerable workers”) that displays modest material capital but very high social capital. Studies 2 and 3 illuminate the adaptive value of vulnerable workers’ high social capital, with this group reporting similar mental and physical health outcomes to the middle/upper class (Studies 2 and 3) and leveraging their social networks to protect against health impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic (Study 3). Our work reveals that tradeoffs between material and social capital occur most reliably at the group (not individual) level; that class effects are not monotonic, but reflect higher-order interactions between forms of capital; and that LPA can be a fruitful analytic approach when combined with careful theorization, validation of profiles against appropriate covariates, and preregistration.",https://osf.io/ph3ze/,2023-09-18T20:57:39.897273,"['nfendinger@nyu.edu', 'New York University', 'State', ' State']",OSF,

We analyze administrative data from the program, along with data from the census of credit transactions. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in access to credit, both in terms of the likelihood of signing a loan (extensive margin) and the loan amounts (intensive margin). These effects are most pronounced two years after land restitution, coinciding with the moment individuals gain full property rights. By delving into the specific details of these credit transactions, we ascertain that the credits obtained are primarily directed towards agricultural investments.

However, theoretical debates highlight that such behaviors could reflect a strategic attempt to manipulate others in future interactions. The personal deterrence hypothesis claims that punishment is motivated to deter future unfairness towards punishers. Here we tested this hypothesis with a total of n = 248 5-to-10-year-olds. In two experiments, participants witnessed that a divider shared resources either fairly or selfishly with a third party. Participants learned that the same divider (same divider condition) or a new divider (different divider condition) would subsequently decide how to share resources with the participant. If children’s punishment is motivated by personal deterrence, they should punish unfairness more often in the same divider condition (versus different divider). Conversely, if children fear retaliation from dividers, they should punish dividers less often in the same divider condition (versus different divider). Children intervened by taking resources away from the divider (Experiment 1) or by sending a disapproving or an approving verbal message (Experiment 2). Children were more likely to punish unfair than fair allocations through material punishment and disapproving messages, while being more likely to reward fair than unfair allocations by sending approving messages. However, children did so at the same level regardless of their future divider’s identity.

Method: Forty-three adults between 40 and 69 years of age were tested in Mexico City using a traditional clinical pure tone audiogram, cognitive screening, and a battery of PART-based auditory processing assessments including a speech-on-speech competition spatial release from masking task.

A total of 21 individuals aged 18-30 years (14 females) participated in an EMA study over 14 consecutive days. Participants received five prompts per day, answered questions about goal-pursuit, self-control, executive functions, and situational aspects, and completed two cognitive control tasks (Stroop and Go/No-Go). Single-trait multistate models as defined in the (revised) latent state-trait theory were estimated with multilevel structural equation modelling. For the Stroop task error rate and the Go/No-Go task error rate, 32% and 42% were explained by occasion specificity, respectively, while 29% and 37% were explained by consistency, respectively. The Stroop task scores showed excellent between-subject but poor within-subject reliability, while the Go/No-Go task scores showed excellent between-subject and moderate within-subject reliability. The Stroop and Go/No-Go task scores did not correlate with each other and with self-report measures after between-subject variance was removed. By using 80 Go/No-Go trials per assessment it is possible to measure within-subject fluctuations of cognitive control with moderate reliability in the EMA context.

Therefore, it is important to conduct a detailed study and determine the reason for such a large variability of behavioral reactions to stress and create a prescriptive classification for clinical and psychological intervention. This will make it possible to automate the distribution of victims, increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy and thus improve the mental health of the population in the conditions of war.

We consider it necessary to highlight the functional states of the anterior parts of the brain, which became the basis for the definition of neuropersonal types. According to Bohdan Tkach's concept, the functional states of neuropersonological types are continuous. Its extreme options are strengthening and weakening.

We emphasize that by the term ""enhancement"" we mean the above-normotypical course of metacognitive functions, where the idea of reinforcement is understood as the established tendency of movement towards a state of genius. At the same time, the ""weakening"" of the function of the metacognitive sphere is the lower limit of an individual's ability to be adapted in society.
Empirical research included the identification of the main targets, in particular:
- Determining the level of stress resistance
- Determination of neuropersonality types of subjects
- Determination of the level of psychological attraction to poverty

The randomized sample consists of 437 respondents, including 181 male respondents and 256 female respondents. 

The level of stress resistance and social adaptation in neuropersonality types depending on the level of psychological tendency to poverty are correlated. 

Therefore, in the conditions of war, individuals with a functional weakening of the dorsolateral part of the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex of the brain from groups with a high and above average level of psychological attraction to poverty are vulnerable to stress resistance and social maladaptation. As we can see, these persons need urgent psychological help. Accordingly, programs of psychoprophylaxis of stress, resocialization of persons with acute stress disorders and adaptation disorders should consider the specificity of these neuropersonality types.

Individuals in need of psychological help who do not need it are those who correspond to the type of functional weakening of the ventromedial part of the prefrontal cortex of the brain with a low level of psychological attraction to poverty. These individuals in the conditions of war can see new perspectives and use them to their own advantage.

Our proposed conclusions can be of fundamental importance for the organization of psychological assistance to victims of military aggression in different countries. Since it is already obvious that soon military conflicts and new fronts may probably be opened in the countries of the Arab world, Asia, the Indian and Pacific basins.",https://osf.io/b2gd3/,2023-09-18T15:12:42.076547,[],OSF,

Considering that such modelling always results in non-linear differential equations, not analytically solvable, this is certainly one of the causes, driving scientists to search for possible simplifications.
When technological advances gave researchers computer programs capable of numerically solving these non-linear equations, effectively removing the first cause, the same advances also produced improvements in the measurement of time and of gravitational acceleration (one of the utilities for pendulums) so that these devices have lost their usefulness as experimental instruments and consequently as subjects of interest to scientists as possible research field. There is a third cause: pendulums on Earth are always too short for the mentioned non-linearity to manifest itself, because the assumption of a constant gravitational acceleration g is sufficient to arrive to more manageable models.
This paper is a revisitation of pendulum motion analysis using Newton’s equations, not restricted to constant gravitational acceleration g. A numerical example is solved, and plotting of angles, forces and energies is presented.

However, previous studies have often relied on small non-representative samples and/or on a limited range of measures. In addition, experience of precarity (uncertainty in meeting basic needs) could change how wealth correlates with prosociality, yet its impact remains unknown. Using data from 80,337 people across 76 countries, we show that both objective wealth (household income), and subjective wealth (financial well-being), are positively and consistently associated with higher prosociality. Objective wealth was positively associated with altruism, positive reciprocity, donating money, volunteering, and helping a stranger, but negatively associated with trust. Subjective wealth was positively associated with all aspects of prosociality, including trust. Experience of precarity reduced associations between wealth and prosocial preferences yet increased them for prosocial behaviours. These findings could have important implications for enhancing prosociality, critical for a healthy and adaptive society.",https://psyarxiv.com/zc5a3/,2023-09-18T10:36:11.766166,"['P.L.Lockwood@bham.ac.uk', 'ppv@bham.ac.uk', 'UK']",OSF,

Teachers are expected to possess a strong foundation in scientific literacy, to remain perpetually informed and to meaningfully participate in research. It is unclear if and how the CSEN vision is received by teachers. 

We investigated: (1) Where French primary school teachers’ knowledge about learning comes from; (2) How they define ‘evidence-based’ education; (3) How they know that a pedagogical method ‘works’; (4) What conditions they believe are important for a successful collaboration between researchers and teachers. 

Fourteen teachers participated in semi-structured focus groups. Thematic analyses shed light on the four research questions. First, teachers were frustrated about their professional training and proactively used complementary resources. Second, although most teachers were familiar with research, several of them saw scientists as belonging to a different ‘crew’. Teachers use a diversity of methods to evaluate pedagogical practices, considering that research evidence brings legitimacy to their decisions, yet does not replace their professional intuition. Third, teachers use evaluation tools, a positive classroom climate and observations of children taking ownership of their learning as evidence of good practice.

(NSAIDs) in endurance sports, despite the lack of consistent evidence for their
ergogenic effects, raises questions about potential benefits beyond pain
management and the specific adverse consequences they might entail. Contrary
to the intended outcomes, NSAIDs have shown mixed effectiveness in alleviating
inflammation during or after exercise, mainly showing harmful consequences in
running. These contraproductive effects are particularly concerning for the
gastrointestinal system.
Regarding muscle adaptation, high doses of NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit
muscle growth, while moderate doses have a minor impact. Although the
available studies on the impact of NSAIDs on human mitochondrial biogenesis
are scarce, in vitro experiments suggest potential negative consequences.
Furthermore, the presumed benefits of NSAIDs in promoting healing for soft
tissue, bone injuries, and muscle damage are frequently undermined, potentially
impeding the natural recovery process. Concerns regarding bone healing
encompass delayed callus maturation, compromised mechanical strength, and an
increased fracture risk due to the inhibition of osteoblasts.
In conclusion, endurance athletes are advised to exercise caution when
contemplating the use of NSAIDs without clear indications, as their potential
adverse effects outweigh the limited advantages in terms of performance
enhancement. While short-term NSAID applications may offer transient relief,
alternative strategies should be sought for fostering long-term healing and
optimizing performance.
Considering these findings, this review aims to provide endurance athletes with
insights spanning injury management, training adaptation, race performance, and

The active and quick conditions elicited lower visual N1-P2 peak-to-peak amplitudes than the passive condition but did not significantly differ from each other. For prestimulus ERPs (lateralized/readiness potential; L/RP), all conditions showed a negative shift in RP, with lower amplitudes in the quick than in the active condition. There were no significant differences between active and passive. For the LRP, the active and quick conditions showed a sharp deflection shortly before the button press. The amplitude of both conditions was significantly lower than passive around 100 ms before the movement.

This coupling between action and confidence can be disrupted, as has been found in individuals with high compulsivity symptoms. Patients with Gambling Disorder (GD) have been shown to exhibit both higher confidence and deficits in learning. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that patients with GD display increased confidence, reduced action updating and lower learning rates. Additionally, we investigated whether the action-confidence coupling was distorted in patients with GD. To address this, 27 patients with GD and 30 healthy controls performed a predictive inference task designed to assess action and confidence dynamics during learning under volatility. Action-updating, confidence and their coupling were assessed and computational modeling estimated parameters for learning rates, error sensitivity, and sensitivity to environmental changes. Contrary to our expectations, results revealed no significant group differences in action updating or confidence levels. Nevertheless, GD patients exhibited a weakened coupling between confidence and action, as well as lower learning rates. This suggests that patients with GD may underutilize confidence when steering future behavioral choices. Ultimately, these findings point to a disruption of metacognitive control in GD, without a general overconfidence bias in neutral, non-incentivized volatile learning contexts.",https://psyarxiv.com/nv67e/,2023-09-18T07:32:40.740881,['m.hoven@amsterdamumc.nl'],OSF,

As an alternative to the currently clinically available valve substitutes, tissue-engineered heart valves hold the promise of realizing these features using bioresorbable materials that can host endogenous cells and are replaced by cell-secreted matrices in vivo over time, yielding a living valve in the patient’s heart. During nearly three decades, a variety of biomaterials and biofabrication techniques have been utilized to develop tissue-engineered heart valves. However, the quest for an ideal combination of biomaterial and biofabrication strategy to achieve longevity in these heart valve substitutes continues. Attempting to overcome various obstacles to this goal, the approach to heart valve tissue engineering has continuously evolved. Most notable examples are the application of biomechanical conditioning via dynamic cultures instead of growing valves in static condition to generate robust tissues that are capable of enduring hemodynamic loads upon implantation and more recently, implantation of acellular instead of cell-laden valves to avoid adverse in-vivo tissue remodelling.

To address these measurement issues, the current studies developed the Parenting Styles Circumplex Inventory (PSCI) which is rooted in Contemporary Integrative Interpersonal Theory and provides a framework to unite typology and dimensional parenting style measurement approaches. The current article describes the development and initial validation of the PSCI across three samples of college students (Ns=571, 361, 385). The 32-item PSCI consists of 8 octant scales which each assess unique combinations of parental responsiveness and demandingness. The measure asks respondents to answer each question about their mother- and/or father-figure.

Over the decades, the mechanism through which particle separation occurs has been slowly understood. Particles tend to reach equilibrium positions in channeled flow under the influence of inertial forces. In the last decade, particle separation techniques based on inertial forces have been applied to cell-sorting microfluidics devices, improving throughput with simple and precise manipulation of fluid flow in point-of-care and clinical diagnostics. The designs are based on the Segre-Silberberg effect along a straight section of a channel and Dean's effect in a curvilinear channel. In this study, we focus on the study of Dean's effect, which depends on the curvilinear nature of the channel. The presence of a curvilinear channel induces rotating Dean's vortices, which lead to the separation of particles in the channel. Based on numerical simulations using a custom-designed channel, our results show Dean's vortices develop initially at a low Dean's number on the inner radius side of a curved channel near the top and bottom corners. As Dean's number increases, Dean's vortices transition to the central parts of the channel, symmetrically placed above and below the central plane. Analysis of lift forces on a small neutrally buoyant sphere in the curvilinear channel shows that the sphere tends to be focused at the central positions of the channel, consistent with the positions of the Dean's vortices present in the curvilinear channel at the corresponding Dean's number.",https://osf.io/sxz7g/,2023-09-17T22:48:12.666676,"['xiwang@s.sfusd.edu', 'San Francisco ', 'USA']",OSF,

To arrive at a better understanding of the causes and the extent of deviations in sound reproduction, differences in the amplitude, phase and frequency of a sound signal at various stages in the process of reproduction were measured and compared under a set of controlled conditions, one of them being the presence of a human subject in the acoustic environment. Deviations in acoustic reproduction were found to be significantly smaller than ± 0.1 dB amplitude and ± 1 degree phase shift when comparing trials recorded on the same day. Deviations significantly increased greater than 5 times the amplitude and 6 times the phase shift when comparing trials recorded on different days. Deviations further increased significantly with greater than 59 times the amplitude and 32 times the phase shift with a human subject present in the acoustic environment. For the first time, it was shown that the human body does not always absorb, but can also amplify sound energy.  The degree of either absorption or amplification per frequency shows consistent variance in response to the subject and changes in the stimulus, indicating a non-linear relationship between the observed deviations and the presence of the human subject.

Calculation of zakat and poverty rates, the number of workers who issue professional zakat can be the answer to straighten out the mistakes of people who have not received professional zakat.

One of the tasks of zakat management institutions whose existence is protected by law is to realize the role of zakat as a solution to overcome poverty. Productive zakat is to increase or as business capital mustahiq. Zakat results in a redistribution of market commodities from the rich to the poor.

Societal change is required to mitigate the negative effects of climate change, as well as help people adapt to the associated health risks. This requires situation-specific, large-scale data that can help identify the relevant areas for policymaking and communication. Such behavioral data can help scientists and policymakers understand public perceptions and behaviors, as well as identify the levers to increase public readiness to act (RTA) against climate change and protect their health. The Planetary Health Action Survey (PACE) explores RTA, integrating individual behavior, policy acceptance, and political participation as its key indicators and determinants. The survey seeks to develop and refine an integrated conceptual model of RTA, create valid corresponding measurement instruments, and implement them in monitoring. This contribution serves as the study protocol for PACE.
Methods: In cross-sectional data collections, a comprehensive set of sociocognitive factors, including climate change knowledge, trust in institutions, perceived health risks, self-efficacy, social norms, and perceived effectiveness of policy measures, are assessed.

To fill these gaps in HE curriculum discussion and literature, this paper will examine a new approach to curricular design - a cross-disciplinary model applicable to both unit (academic module that makes up a program) and program (degree) levels of curriculum development. This model has been developed by drawing on elements of Agile mindset and Backward Design and we call it Agile Backward Design (ABD).

In ABD, the researchers have constructed a dynamic, and responsive framework that has been foundational in the design and development of innovative curriculum and pedagogy at the unit and program level of undergraduate degrees in both IT and education discipline areas.

Necessary assumptions and limitations – both conceptually and methodologically – are discussed. Results: We estimate the number of Afro-descendants in Switzerland in 2021 to be around 230 to 240 thousand persons (around 2.6% of the resident population).

Viewed in this way, these pursuits become largely logical problems to solve—if-else rules that designate or classify the occurrence of an outcome. The challenge becomes how to build sets of necessary conditions and how to identify the sets that are sufficient for the outcome. We propose a two-stage approach in which sets of concurrent and/or sequential elements are built iteratively from singles to pairs to triples and so forth via mutual information. Sets are encoded as dichotomous variables via Boolean operators. The explanation of the response variable is optimized by one of two methods, either the minimization of the conditional entropy or the maximization of the conditional probability. Moreover, we eschew a deterministic causal approach for a stochastic framework, wherein we examine necessary and sufficient conditions for the likelihood of event above or below an arbitrary threshold of probability or entropy. Two empirical demonstrations are provided, one cross-sectional and between-persons and one from person-specific time series. We demonstrate how the treatment of compound sets as dichotomous variables effectively compresses the information about the concurrence or sequence of set elements into a binary encoding.

Based on this, we propose that though initially, participants respond to the intervention, there is a hypothesized second diminishing effect of an intervention. However, we suggest that on top, there is a third effect. Independent of the individual notification or nudge, people could build the knowledge, skills and practice needed to independently engage in the behavior themselves (schraefel and Hekler, 2020).
Using behavioral theory and inspired by prior animal computational models of behavior, we propose a dynamical computational model to allow for a separation of intervention and internalization. It is targeted towards the specific case of the HeartSteps intervention that could not explain a diminishing immediate effect of the intervention, second hypothesized effect, while a person’s overall steps remained constant, third effect (Klasnja et al., 2019). We incorporate a habituation mechanism from learning theory that can account for the immediate diminishing effect. At the same time, a reinforcement mechanism allows participants to internalize the message and engage in behavior independently. The simulation shows the importance of a participant’s responsiveness to the intervention and a sufficient recovery period after each notification. To estimate the model, we use data from the HeartSteps intervention (Klasnja et al., 2019; Liao et al., 2020), a just-in-time adaptive intervention that sent two to five walking suggestions per day. We run a Bayesian estimation with Stan in R.
Additional validation tests are needed to estimate the accuracy of the model for different individuals. It could however serve as a template for future just-in-time adaptive interventions due to its generic structure. In addition, this model is of high practical relevance as its derived dynamics can be used to improve future walking suggestions and ultimately optimize notification-based digital health interventions.",https://osf.io/6v7d5/,2023-09-16T14:14:28.422765,"['University of California', 'University of California ', 'California', 'lisa.gotzian@stud.leuphana.de', 'Cal']",OSF,

In this paper, I examine the state of Louisiana’s changing approach to managing its coastal region in order to illuminate this question. During the 20th century, coastal management displayed the dynamics that characterize regional growth machines: a coalition of economic and political elites worked to attract public funding for economic development projects, while simultaneously resisting the implementation of state and federal regulations concerning land use and natural resource extraction. The rapid industrial development and public infrastructure projects of this period helped to usher in an ongoing regional environmental crisis that involves the gradual disappearance of coastal wetlands areas, and which places ecosystems, communities, and economic infrastructure in jeopardy. More recently, the state has developed and adopted an ambitious plan for coastal environmental protection and restoration. This plan has won accolades from influential environmental organizations and has attracted the support of prominent members of the coastal science community. 
On closer inspection, it is clear that while the level of concern for coastal environments has changed over the course of these two periods, significant continuities also exist. Perhaps the most striking continuity lies in the continued role of growth machine actors – business leaders, pro-business politicians, and economic development organizations – in driving the current coastal restoration and protection agenda. The leadership role of these elite actors shapes the state’s approach to environmental restoration in significant ways: restoration plans continue to emphasize the use of public funds for infrastructure projects, while downplaying the need for new land use regulations or for other requirements that might be perceived as economically burdensome. I propose that thinking of elite growth advocacy as adaptive problem solving helps to explain both the changes and the continuities. This conceptualization provides insights into the resilience of growth machines in the face of environmental crises, including those related to climate change, while also suggesting that growth machine dynamics do not prevent (but do shape) responses to crises.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5e8pg/,2023-09-17T13:36:39.796239,"['SU', 'University of Maine', 'CU', 'michael.haedicke@maine.edu', 'University of Maine ', 'ND', 'UT', 'NU', 'AU', 'UIS', 'Drake University', 'OU']",OSF,

Differences in motor function both persist across the lifespan and scale linearly with the magnitude of core ASD symptom presentation. Because motor differences may be apparent earlier than core autism features, objective, quantifiable measures of motor function may help clinicians with early detection of neurodevelopmental delays/deviance, early diagnosis of ASD, and later differential diagnosis. Moreover, nuanced motor biomarkers represent a promising approach to parse presumed mechanistic heterogeneity across the autism spectrum, particularly as it relates to guiding precision intervention. To achieve these mechanistic-science and biomarker-development goals, we propose approaches to transcend limitations we see within the corpus of autism motor research as a whole. First, we suggest more transdiagnostic research to establish the specificity of particular motor behaviors for autism (vs. other neurodevelopmental conditions that also show motor atypicalities). Relatedly, enhancing the specificity of both motor constructs and core-symptom constructs (social-communicative, restricted and repetitive behaviors/interests [RRB]) within autism sensory-motor research will be essential for parsing the heterogeneity within the autism spectrum. Finally, in order to sharpen our mechanistic understanding, we recommend experimental designs that simultaneously and competitively test multiple cognitive-motor theories of autism within frameworks of Computational Motor Control and Bayesian Inference, as this approach will aid in developing clinically meaningful objective motor biomarkers based on mechanism. Each of the cognitive-motor theories we discuss in the chapter (hypo-priors, hyper-priors, prediction, inter-sensory bias, and sensory-motor transformation) ascribes different features of autism to different mechanisms; we recognize that different mechanisms may be at play across individuals within the heterogeneous autism spectrum in a way that accounts for both motor and non-motor heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss neuroanatomical correlates that may underpin each theory proposed, providing a brain-behavioral link between the early emerging “lower-level” features of autism (i.e., motor differences and low-order RRBs) and developmentally later emerging higher-level ASD symptomology (i.e., social communication differences and high-level RRBs).",https://psyarxiv.com/hxd67/,2023-09-15T19:30:58.727054,"['Johns Hopkins University', 'Hopkins']",OSF,

Prioritization from WM is sufficiently strong to direct attention towards items that are irrelevant to current search goals. These ‘incidental capture’ results have typically been observed when remembering color or shape stimuli, but, in principle, should similarly occur using other strong guiding features such as motion. However, recent work suggests that neural representations of remembered motion directions are transformed into spatial coordinates. If so, then remembered stimuli which can easily be spatially recoded (e.g., remembered motion direction) should not interfere with visual search when feature-matching distractors are present any more than interference caused by a salient distractor that does not match the contents of WM. We replicated the traditional incidental capture finding for color: distractors matching the remembered color captured attention more than feature singletons. In contrast, when participants were required to remember a motion direction, capture was equal across distractor conditions: salient distractors captured attention, but no additional capture was observed when the remembered motion direction matched the distracting motion direction. Intriguingly, responses were faster when the search target was at a location that neural studies predict would be prioritized if remembered motion was spatially recoded. Our results indicate that some features in WM are more likely to impact attentional processing than others and that this difference in attentional capture between feature dimensions may emerge due to the ability to reformat memory representations.",https://psyarxiv.com/sx6d5/,2023-09-15T19:06:37.111735,"['danielthayer@ucsb.edu', 'University of California', 'University of California ', 'California', 'tsprague@ucsb.edu', 'Cal']",OSF,

The predictive coding account of delusions, which is based in cognitive neuroscience, has increasing experimental support to explain how delusions are formed and maintained. Learning is central to both predictive coding and CBTp. Each emphasizes belief updating in response to new or surprising experiences. Despite their commonalities, treatment-related changes observed with CBTp have yet to be integrated into the predictive coding framework. Here, we adumbrate how CBTp may mollify aberrant learning processes central to the predictive coding explanation of delusions. Delusions become fixed via failure of extinction learning and inappropriate reconsolidation of prior beliefs that underwrite delusions. For persecutory delusions, a strong prior belief that the world is volatile promotes this reconsolidation, as innocuous stimuli are interpreted as evidence that the environment is changing and cannot be trusted. We suggest that CBTp reduces behaviors that trigger reconsolidation of delusional priors and increase behaviors that promote the updating of new, more adaptive beliefs. Engaging alternate, non-delusional, explanations for delusional experiences boosts extinction learning. Framing CBTp in this way proffers the exciting possibility of augmenting its impact by leveraging the neural insights of predictive coding.",https://psyarxiv.com/2ab8m/,2023-09-15T18:26:58.308581,"['USA', ' State', 'Vanderbilt University', 'State', 'RU']",OSF,

We evaluated the children’s performance at four language levels in production and comprehension domains, using 11 subtests of the standardized language assessment for Russian – RuCLAB. Using the k-means cluster method and RuCLAB scores, we obtained two clusters of children and analyzed their language performance in individual subtests.
Results: The analysis revealed that the two clusters of children both included DLD and TD participants: Group 1, with higher test scores (TD=45, DLD=24 children) and Group 2, with lower scores (TD=8, DLD=29). Children from Group 1 mostly had lower scores at one of the language levels, whereas those from Group 2 struggled at several language levels. At the same time, children with DLD from both Groups tended to be more sensitive to linguistic features like word length, noun case, sentence reversibility, type of question in discourse comprehension compared to TD children.
Conclusions: The presence of two mixed groups shows that children with diagnosed DLD could perform on par with TD children, whereas some younger TD children could perform similarly to children with DLD. Our findings support the continuum/spectrum model: linguistic skills in pre-school children are a continuum, varying from high to poor skills at all language levels in comprehension and production. To describe a child’s language profile, the tasks assessing all language levels should be used.",https://psyarxiv.com/3npwt/,2023-09-15T17:11:34.640560,"['val.lezzhova@gmail.com', 'militina.gomozova@ya.ru', 'odragoy@hse.ru', 'UK', 'nastya.lopukhina@gmail.com']",OSF,

Attention bias is the tendency to attend preferentially to threat-related stimuli and has been consistently observed in high anxious samples. Naturally, interventions aiming to modify these biases have been developed with the hopes of alleviating anxiety symptoms. However, while initial studies were promising, over time the reported efficacy of these attention bias modification (ABM) procedures in alleviating symptoms has become mixed, with some studies reporting moderate to large effect sizes, and others reporting non-significant effects. Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the potential for demand effects to be underlying previous significant findings. Therefore, we revisit the efficacy of ABM as a method for alleviating both attention bias, and in turn anxiety symptomology. As our primary objective we seek to conduct a direct replication of one of the seminal studies showing successful alleviation of anxiety symptoms using multi-session ABM training (Hazen et al., 2009), while adopting a Bayesian approach to analyses.

In recent years, the ‘temporal sampling’ account of dyslexia has evolved considerably, with contributions from neurogenetics and novel imaging methods resulting in a much more complex etiological view of the disorder. The original temporal sampling framework implicates disrupted neural entrainment to speech as a causal factor for atypical phonological representations. Yet, empirical findings have not provided clear evidence of a low-level etiology for this endophenotype. In contrast the neural noise hypothesis presents a theoretical view of the manifestation of dyslexia from the level of genes to behavior. However, its relative novelty (being published in 2017) means that empirical research focused on its specific predictions is sparse. The current paper reviews dyslexia research using a dual framework from the temporal sampling and neural noise hypotheses and discusses the complementary nature of these two views of dyslexia. We present an argument for an integrated model of sensory temporal sampling as an etiological pathway for dyslexia.

Morphological awareness, or sensitivity to the smallest units of meaning, is a language skill that facilitates fluent recognition of meaning in print. Yet despite the growing evidence that morphology is integral to literacy success, associations between morphological awareness, literacy acquisition, and brain development remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal investigation with seventy-five elementary school children, ages 5-11, who completed an auditory morphological awareness neuroimaging task at Time 1 as well as literacy assessments at both Time 1 and Time 2 (1.5 years later). Findings reveal longitudinal brain-behavior associations between morphological processing at Time 1 and reading outcomes at Time 2. First, activation in superior temporal brain regions involved in word segmentation was associated with both future reading skill and steeper reading gains over time. Second, a wider array of brain regions across the language network were associated with polymorphemic word reading as compared to broader word reading skill (reading simple and complex words). Together, these findings reinforce the importance of word segmentation skills in learning to read and highlight the importance of considering complex word reading skills in building comprehensive neurocognitive models of literacy.

In this Perspective, we outline 5 major challenges in the p-factor literature, namely that it has: (1) mistakenly equated good model fit with validity; (2) sought to corroborate weak p-factor theories through underspecified construct validation efforts; (3) produced poorly replicated general factors of psychopathology; (4) violated assumptions of latent variable models; and (5) reified general factors of psychopathology as latent, causal entities, in turn neglecting alternative models that do not incorporate a p-factor and are entirely incompatible with the notion that a single dimension adequately summarizes variation in all forms of psychopathology. Each of these challenges raise questions about substantive interpretations of the p-factor (i.e., negative emotionality, thought disorder), undermining the field’s confidence that the p-factor is a real, latent entity, or that GFPs are useful summaries of psychopathology variation.

We propose a polytomous Item Response Theory (IRT) model that incorporates a specification of the mechanism behind the binning process by which individuals select the cut points that they use to map their underlying continuous state to the discrete response options. Individuals select these cut points by minimizing the expected error made in communicating their experienced mental state relative to their beliefs about a reference distribution held by the interviewer. We are thus able to disentangle the distinct process of selecting cut points to optimize expected communication, from that associated with a specific realization of a mental state. We apply the model to data collected on anxiety among 800 respondents. The results show that the proposed model fits the data better than classical IRT models which treat cut points as (homogeneous or heterogeneous) incidental parameters.

Many psychotherapies aim to help people replace maladaptive mental behaviors (such as those leading to unproductive worry) with more adaptive ones (such as those leading to active problem solving). Yet, little is known about how challenging it is to learn adaptive mental behaviors. Mental behaviors entail taking mental operations and thus may be more challenging to perform than simple motor actions. The challenge of performing mental actions may either enhance or impair learning their expected values (compared to the more standard case of learning the expected values of motor actions). In particular, greater challenge when learning is often desirable because it improves retention. Yet, it is also plausible that the necessity of carrying out mental operations interferes with learning the expected values of mental actions by impeding credit assignment: the process of updating an action’s value after reinforcement. Then, it may be more challenging not only to perform—but also to learn—the consequences of mental (vs. simple motor) behaviors. We designed a task to assess learning to take optimal mental vs. motor actions via matched probabilistic feedback. In two experiments (N=300), the majority of participants found it more difficult to learn to select optimal mental (vs. motor) actions, as evident in worse accuracy not only in a learning but also test (retention) phase. Computational modeling traced this impairment to an indicator of worse credit assignment (impaired construction and maintenance of precise expected values) when learning mental actions, which accounted for worse accuracy in both the learning and test phases. The results suggest that people tend to have particular difficulty learning adaptive mental behavior and pave the way for novel interventions to scaffold credit assignment and thereby promote adaptive thinking.",https://psyarxiv.com/agprs/,2023-09-15T13:42:33.036315,"['Brown University', 'peter.hitchcock@emory.edu', 'Emory University', 'Brown']",OSF,

Based on this mathematics Einstein predicted correctly the deflection of light by the gravitational field of the sun, observed in the Eddington Experiment in 1919 during a total solar eclipse.

In theoretical physics, the problem of time is a conceptual conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics regards the flow of time as universal and absolute, whereas general relativity regards the flow of time as malleable and relative.

The theory of General Relativity correctly does not predict an increase or decrease of the speed of light within a gravitational field. Because within the (gravitational)  curvature of space and time, the  intervals for the space coordinates and time coordinate do not change. Only the direction of the beam of light has been changed, following the (by a gravitational field caused) curved space-time path. For this reason the Theory of General Relativity predicts a constant value for the frequency of the light following a curved space-time path [37], [41]. Because the time intervals and he space interval do not change within the curvature. A straight line being transformed into a circle does not get shorter or longer. Only the Lorentz time-dilation and the Lorentz space contraction have to be taken into account. The Lorentz contraction and time dilation can be neglected in the experiments for Gravitational Redshift. 

All publications related to the well observed effects of “Gravitational RedShift/ Blueshift” within a gravitational field explain this effect by the frequency shift due to the shift in potential energy within a gravitational field. The proportional relationship between (potential) energy and frequency is Planck’s law and has nothing to do with the theory of general relativity. The observed effects of Gravitational Redshift is in contradiction with the Theory of General Relativity. Because a curved space-time geometry does not change the time intervals and does not change the space intervals within a gravitational field. Only the direction of the beam of light will change and follow the curved 4-dimensional space-time geometry. A change of the magnitude of the speed of light has never been observed within gravitational fields. 

The only theory which predicts Gravitational Redshift correctly, with margins smaller than 15 digits beyond the decimal point, is the new theory presented in this article.

I argue that occupational licensing alters wage setting, depending on the characteristics of the licensing system. Licensing does not only restrict market entry as in the US. Some governments, like that of Germany, also regulate task prices and set occupation-specific wage floors for licensed occupations. I claim that the US system leads to a growing licensing wage advantage across the distribution, and that the German system leads to a falling one. Furthermore, I discuss that women may benefit especially from licensing, because for them it reduces typical disadvantage in the wage setting. I present unconditional and gender-specific quantile treatment effects based on CPS-MORG and BIBB/BAuA data from 2018. In the US, wage premiums are highest for employees in the upper middle and are small for those in the bottom and the top. For Germany, the wage premium is the largest for licensed employees at within the lower quarter and reduces significantly towards the top. In both countries, women profit significantly more from licensing. These results challenge claims about the role of licensing for inequality in the top, and suggest that licensing reduce penalties faced by disadvantaged groups.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/urp25/,2023-09-15T12:42:41.425665,['andreas.haupt@kit.ed'],OSF,

However, volition is difficult to capture in the experimental laboratory. Previous studies often focussed on initiation of arbitrary, inconsequential actions, and struggled to provide convincing methodologies for studying volition. This study aimed to enrich the experimental study of volition by developing a new view of volition as means-ends problem solving, through investigating planning and execution of action sequences that approach a goal. In an fMRI experiment, we used the neuropsychological ‘Tower of London’ task to reveal the neurofunctional underpinnings of goal-directed voluntary actions in comparison to the instructed, stimulus-driven execution of the same task. Our results show the medial frontal cortex activations that are characteristic of voluntary, as opposed to stimulus-triggered actions, most notably during the planning phase. Finally, we showed functional connectivity between medial frontal cortex and multiple prefrontal regions such as the superior frontal gyrus and anterior and middle cingulate cortex. We suggest this connectivity links generation of each individual action to the wider networks for planning, goal representation and other executive function.

If it is understood narrowly as an institutionalized field of research defined by a specific research community and publication outlets, social inequality has remained largely neglected in SVE. But if it is understood more broadly as a perspective defined by a dedicated interest in (e)valuation, there are, in fact, several strands of sociological research that are concerned with both social inequality and processes and practices of (e)valuation – even though they are not considered part of the institutionalized field of SVE. Focusing on research that has evolved around four key concepts drawn from the sociological canon – classification, consecration, stigmatization, and homophily – the main part of the chapter offers a discussion of these existing lines of scholarship and shows how they contribute to our understanding of the relationship of (e)valuation and social inequality.

Combining insights from research on signalling and parochial cooperation, we incorporate a trust game with signalling in an agent-based model to study the dynamics of signalling norm emergence in groups with conflicting interests. Our results show that costly signalling norms emerge from random acts of signalling in minority groups that benefit most from parochial cooperation. Majority groups are less likely to develop costly signalling norms. Yet, norms that prescribe sending costless group identity signals can easily emerge in groups of all sizes – albeit, at times, at the expense of minority group members. Further, the dynamics of signalling norm emergence differ across signal costs, relative group sizes, and levels of ingroup assortment.

Our findings identified distinct communities of emotions and emotion reg-ulation strategies, wherein taking action and reappraisal held a particularly central position for explaining their linkages.

To address this, we investigated whether (1) producing isometric forces according to RPE levels reliably leads to differences in force output, (2) if feelings of effort map linearly or non-linearly onto force output, and (3) if this mapping is robust when visual feedback and social facilitation are present. In a counterbalanced repeated measures design, N = 26 participants performed isometric handgrip contractions prescribed by ten levels of the Borg CR-10 scale. They did so either with or without the availability of concurrent visual feedback regarding their force production, and in the presence or absence of another person performing the same task simultaneously. We found that subjects reliably produced different force outputs that corresponded to each RPE level. Furthermore, concurrent visual feedback led to a linearization of force output, while in the absence of feedback, the produced forces could also be described by quadratic and cubic functions. Exploratory post-hoc analyses revealed that participants perceived moderate RPE levels to be more challenging to produce. By shedding light on the dynamic nature of the mapping between RPE and objective performance, our findings provide helpful insights regarding the utility of RPE scales.",https://psyarxiv.com/psvhm/,2023-09-15T09:55:06.656094,['UNI'],OSF,

Twelve experiments suggest these reputational concerns are systematically miscalibrated, creating a misplaced barrier to honesty in relationships. In hypothetical scenarios (Experiments 1, S1, &amp; S2), laboratory experiments (Experiments 2 &amp; 6), and field settings (Experiments 3 &amp; 4), those who imagined revealing, or who actually revealed, negative information they were keeping secret expected to be judged significantly more harshly than recipients expected to judge, or actually judged, them. We theorized that revealers’ pessimistic expectations stem not only from the cognitive accessibility of negative information (Experiment S3), but also from a perspective gap such that the negative outcomes of disclosing this information, compared to positive outcomes, are more accessible for prospective revealers than for recipients. Consistent with this mechanism, revealers’ expectations were better calibrated when directed to focus on positive thoughts, or when they considered revealing positive information (Experiments 5, 6, &amp; S4). Revealers’ miscalibrated expectations matter because they can guide decisions about whether to reveal information or conceal it as a secret (Experiment S5). As predicted, calibrating revealers’ expectations increased their willingness to reveal negative information to others (Experiment 7), suggesting that miscalibrated fears of others’ judgment create a misplaced barrier to honesty in relationships.

We then correlated changes in maturity of human resources, management, and development attributes including use of HRH data for decision-making in HRH Kenya counties with changes in absenteeism. Between 2018 and 2012, HRH Kenya counties saw absenteeism reduced by 12 percentage points (p&lt;0.28) compared to counties not exposed to HRH Kenya and by 2 percentage points (p&lt;0.71) compared to national level trends.

the universe since its material outset is inferred
to stem from such a generalization of the first law 
of thermodynamics as also covers gravitation. Growth
of the total entropy in a comoving \mbox{Friedmann} volume
is launched when such a global equilibrium is perturbed with
effects of attractive gravitation. It is then underlain by two
opposite time arrows definable with the respective gravitational
energies of material phases equally created in such a volume from 
vacuum decay. Due to thermodynamic equilibrium of this process, 
either of these phases arises homogeneously throughout its entire
\mbox{Friedmann} universe. Having first randomly dominated their opposite
time arrows, such matter and antimatter thereby polarize the disintegrating
vacuum phase with their independent effects of attractive gravitation and hence
separate these created phases in terms of their time arrows. For two gravitationally
independent material phases created cosmically, their macroscopic inverse of time
is equivalent to the identical change of their creation entropies with the
respective times. Driven by repulsion of the decaying vacuum phase, cosmic 
expansion thus largely begets mutually inaccessible matter and antimatter.

Not much is known about the differences in these representations across body districts, for example, hands, feet, and whole-body, despite their differences at sensory and functional levels. To understand this, we developed more implicit and explicit measures of body satisfaction for these body districts. Sixty-seven participants (age M = 30.66, SD = 11.19) completed a series of online Implicit Association Tests (IAT) and a Body Image Satisfaction Visual Analogue Scale (BISVAS; explicit) for each body district (hands/feet/whole body). The results show no differences in the more implicit level of awareness in hands, feet and whole body, while differences are apparent at a more explicit level of awareness, with higher scores for body image satisfaction for the hands than the whole body and marginally significant lower scores for feet than hands.

A lot of the recent writing has focused on concerns of causal identification (under which conditions is it, in principle, possible to recover causal effects?); in this primer, we turn to causal estimation (how do we actually turn the data into an effect estimate?) and modern approaches to it that are commonly used in epidemiology. First, we explain how causal estimands can be defined rigorously with the help of the potential outcomes framework, and we highlight four crucial assumptions necessary for causal inference to succeed (exchangeability, positivity, consistency, and non-interference). Next, we present three types of approaches to causal estimation and compare their strengths and weaknesses: propensity score methods (in which the independent variable is modeled as a function of controls), g-computation methods (in which the dependent variable is modeled as a function of both controls and the independent variable), and doubly robust estimators (which combine models for both independent and dependent variables).

Thus, we compared ratings of musical clips of varying pulse entropy in either the most common Western meter (4/4) or uncommon meters that Western listeners would be less familiar with. In three online behavioral studies (N=383), we show that 1) perceived rhythmic complexity can be manipulated orthogonally to meter, 2) moderate rhythmic complexity only evokes the greatest groove in common meters whereas more rhythmically simple music elicits the greatest groove ratings in uncommon meters, and 3) these results are unaffected by presentation context.

Participants (30 schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder [SZ]; 30 controls) completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Computational modeling captured subprocesses of uncertain-risk decision-making: Risk Propensity, Prior Belief of Success, Learning Rate, and Behavioral Consistency. Key factors of cognition, risk-specific processes (i.e., Perceived Risks and Expected Benefit of Risks), and non-risk specific personality traits (i.e., defeatist beliefs; hedonic tone) are examined for relationships with Risk Propensity to determine what contributes to group and individual differences in risky reward pursuit. On the BART, the SZ group exhibited lower Risk Propensity, despite higher Prior Beliefs of Success and comparable Learning Rates. In the full sample, Risk Propensity and Prior Beliefs were positively and negatively related to IQ, respectively. Linear models predicting Risk Propensity with self-reported Perceived Risks revealed interactions between group and Perceived Risk, in addition to IQ and Perceived Risk. Specifically, in both the SZ group and individuals with below median IQ, lower Perceived Risks was related to lower Risk Propensity. Thus, within these groups, lower perception of real-world financial risks was associated with less advantageous pursuit of uncertain-risk rewards on the BART. Findings may suggest decreased risk-taking on the BART in SZ reflects risk imperception: The failure to accurately perceive and leverage relevant information to guide advantageous pursuit of risky rewards.",https://psyarxiv.com/sgbr4/,2023-09-14T18:43:31.042126,"['Indiana University ', 'Rutgers University', 'eherms@iu.edu', 'Indiana University', 'Brown', 'Rutgers']",OSF,

A key reason is that previous work is limited by its focus on a single national context and the lack of a systematic comparison between more and less sensitive issues.

Using a counter-factual case study with an implicit comparative design, this paper asks what happens when a state chooses not to engage with social discourse, when it otherwise would be expected to do so. Are there noticeable differences in social discourse when the state does not get involved? Considering the technology transition to the automobile in the early 20th C, historical analysis shows that the outcomes of social discourse around road navigation were extremely similar in Europe, where states were heavily involved in shaping the discourse, and in the United States, where the state was absent. This strongly suggests that neither the states in Europe, nor the state in the United States, were powerful through discourse, as what could “power” possibly mean if it has no consequences under the counter-factual? It also indicates that researchers may overstate their ability to distinguish between situations where actors are powerful through social discourse, what the author calls attributable power, and situations where actors are merely involved in social discourse, but without causing discernible changes to the outcomes with their involvement, what the author calls unattributable power.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5fmzn/,2023-09-15T10:38:21.781040,"[' State', 'UC', 'UCLA', 'Brown', 'State']",OSF,

Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) generates and prioritises valid, personalised outcomes, and has been used in drugs trials involving people living with dementia (PLWD) and is suitable for participants who have heterogeneous outcomes.  We used GAS in a care and support intervention trial, administrated by non-clinical facilitators and this study aims to assesses the goals set by PLWD and their family carers.
METHODS: We developed training and methodology for non-clinical facilitators to set individualised GAS goals with PLWD and family carer dyads, or family carers alone, as the primary outcome in the intervention trial, between March 2020 and May 2022. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of the goals set to explore participants’ main priorities and unmet needs, and to consider how existing GAS goal domains might be extended in a psychological and support intervention trial context. 
RESULTS: 302 participating dyads (92% of those consented) collectively set 1043 (mean 3.5, range 3-5) GAS goals. We deductively coded 719 (69%) goals into five existing GAS domains (Mood, Behaviour, Self-care, Cognition, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)); 324 (31%) goals, which focused on carer wellbeing, were coded into new domains: carer break, carer mood, carer behaviour and carer sleep. The most frequently set goals pertained to social support. There was little variation in types of goals set based on who set them (dyad versus family carer alone) or according to the contemporary pandemic-related restrictions.
DISCUSSION: It is feasible for people without clinical training to administer Goal Attainment Scaling to set individualised, holistic goals for PLWD and family carers in the community. GAS has potential to increase the relevance of trial outcomes for end users of new dementia interventions, including care and support interventions. This can facilitate the roll out of more personalised care.",https://psyarxiv.com/uyz5p/,2023-09-14T15:31:10.162325,"['s.zabihi@qmul.ac.uk', 'Claudia.cooper@qmul.ac.uk', 'Nova', 'n.kupeli@ucl.ac.uk', 'Kenneth.Rockwood@nshealth.ca', 'a.sommerlad@ucl.ac.uk', 'j.budgett@qmul.ac.uk']",OSF,

Moreover, extensive inferential statistical analyses showed several factors such as active experience with drones, general sensitivity to noise, and interest in environmental protection to be significantly associated with the attitudes towards civilian drones and air taxis. The application of three different prediction models revealed that a person’s attitude towards civilian drones could be predicted with up to 71% accuracy by drone-related concerns. In this context, concerns about the violation of privacy and animal welfare had the highest predictive value.

To investigate these interactions, we previously developed a novel experimental study paradigm and a set of computational models, including four game-theoretic models (i.e., two conventional and two behavioral game-theoretic models) and a logit model. The aim of this study is to validate both the lab study and the models with naturalistic data to understand to what extent the results that come out of the lab are comparable to real traffic data. In the experimental study, several pairs of one driver and one pedestrian interacted with each other under different kinematic conditions and at zebra crossings in a virtual environment. The naturalistic data collection was conducted at two marked crossings (normal versus zebra staggered crossing) using state-of-the-art sensors capturing road user type, trajectory, and speed over time. Overall, the results indicated there is a fine relative validity of the experimental study where road users showed similar patterns of non-verbal communication in both studies. Similar to the lab data, crossing type played a role in interaction outcomes and metrics such as pedestrian crossing speed and vehicle delay. Pedestrians crossed more often and walked faster at staggered zebra compared to normal zebra in real traffic. In both studies, vehicle delay was affected by kinematics and location. However, vehicle delay was longer in the lab compared to real traffic. Also, unlike the lab study, pedestrian approach speed was measured and found to be the predictor of their crossing speed and the delay of the drivers. Additionally, all the computational models performed close to each other and well as opposed to the lab study. The behavioral game-theoretic models performed slightly better than the others in terms of prediction accuracy; this replicated our previous findings about road user behavior complexity which is a pivotal point for the virtual testing of automated vehicles.",https://psyarxiv.com/gk9af/,2023-09-14T10:43:44.460114,"['a.h.kalantari@leeds.ac.uk', 'UK']",OSF,

Offshoring involves importing input items from foreign countries at a lower cost, enabling cost-effective production. However, it raises concerns among workers regarding job loss and wage reduction. The aspect of collective bargaining, crucial in understanding the dynamics of offshoring, has often been overlooked in previous research. This journal paper aims to address this research gap by examining the impact of collective bargaining on determining equilibrium wages in the context of offshoring. Through a comprehensive analysis of three cases—Autarky, Small Country, and a two-country scenario—we explore how fluctuations in offshoring costs influence employment levels and wage rates. Additionally, we investigate the policy implications of offshoring decisions in one country and their effects on its partner country. The study also considers the role of skill acquisition in the offshoring process and its multifaceted impact on the labor market. By shedding light on the influence of collective bargaining in determining equilibrium wages within the offshoring framework, this research provides valuable insights for policymakers, academics, and industry practitioners.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of the Reddito di Cittadinanza (RdC), the Five Stars Movement (M5S)’s flagship social policy instrument introduced in 2019, on political support for the party. 
After nearly five years in government between 2018 and 2022, the M5S saw its electoral support plunge from 32.7% to 15.4%. However, this decline was not uniform, with the M5S gaining above 30% in several areas in Southern Italy, and obtaining the relative majority of votes (around 40%) in Campania. Several commentators argued that the relatively good performance of the M5S in Southern Italy was tied to the territorial diffusion of RdC. Does this economic voting narrative hold empirically? And, if so, is the support for the M5S driven by pocketbook motivations, or rather by sociotropic considerations regarding the benefits the RdC brings to the local economy? 
We rely on the Italian National Election Studies (ITANES) post-election survey, which included a specific module on the RdC, and match it with territorial socio-economic data (e.g., employment, poverty, population size) from INPS and ISTAT. We use Linear Probability Models, socio-demographic controls, and geographical Fixed Effects. We find that, irrespective of individual status, support for the M5S is larger in regions and provinces where there are more households with at least one RdC recipient. The relationship between being a RdC recipient (or cohabiting with one) and voting for the M5S holds, at the individual level, only in the absence of contextual controls, while it is otherwise statistically non-significant. We conclude that the electoral support for the M5S in Southern Italy was driven by sociotropic economic voting rather than own-pocket motivations, and that, in the aggregate, this phenomenon might have contributed to the geographic entrenchment of the M5S in Southern Italy.

Here, we examined whether the refreshing-induced memory boost is an all-or-none or a gradual phenomenon. If the beneficial effect of refreshing on memory performance is due to the information being selected for refreshing (i.e., selection hypothesis), an all-or-none memory boost is expected to occur each time an item is selected for refreshing, with better memory performance for items that are selected more often. If, however, the beneficial effect of refreshing on memory performance is due to spending time in the focus of attention during refreshing (i.e., duration hypothesis), a gradual memory boost is expected, with the size of the memory boost being a direct function of how long the item has been the object of focused attention. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we instructed and guided the use of refreshing during retention through the presentation of cues, and varied the number of refreshing steps and their duration independently. The number of refreshing steps, but not their duration, had an effect on recall, in agreement with the selection hypothesis.

Its combination of spatial specificity and mobility makes it particularly attractive for clinical use, both at the bedside and in patients' homes. However, achieving reliable and high-quality signals in real-time fNIRS applications requires careful consideration of two crucial aspects during the preparation and execution phases. First, while fNIRS shows good spatial specificity in capturing superficial cortical brain regions, reliably and consistently targeting specific areas within this region can be challenging, especially when repeated measurements are required. In addition, the variability of cap placement can cause problems due to a lack of anatomical information. Second, minimizing noise in signals used for real-time applications is crucial to ensure that they largely reflect the true underlying brain activity. However, fNIRS signals are prone to contamination from cerebral and extracerebral systemic confounds as well as from motion artifacts. Inadequate real-time preprocessing can result in the system running on noise rather than reliable brain activity.\\

For this purpose, possible optimization options are discussed, which should help to improve the planning process and the implementation of real-time studies and thus facilitate the development of future real-time applications.

In contrast, several other political actors did not experience similar shifts in visibility nor are similar patterns identified in other media outlets. No such effects have been found for favorability.

It incorporates four supporting Research Projects and focuses on socio-economic developments and policy settings that impact access to home ownership. 

While high house prices are often cited as the biggest challenge faced by first homebuyers, this Inquiry highlights that the problem is significantly more complex. Critically, existing policy settings are likely to have exacerbated rather than alleviated the challenge faced by first homebuyers to finance home ownership. Politically seductive measures such as first homeowner grants and tax concessions have failed to arrest declining rates of home ownership.

Those first homebuyers who have been able to buy a home have made a variety of strategy and behavioural changes, including buying more affordable attached dwellings (e.g. units and apartments) that are further away from their household’s social and economic networks, and finding other sources of financing such as from parents. 

The Inquiry makes six key recommendations:

1. Policy to assist entry to home ownership in Australia needs bigger focus on supply side measures
2. Tax-transfer reforms are required as current policy settings disadvantage aspiring first homebuyers and benefit existing home owners

Therefore, the current study aims to examine how school and family environmental education can enhance environmental knowledge, willingness to take action, and pro-environmental behaviors among children and young people. The Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) analytics was utilized on a nationally representative dataset of 2069 Vietnamese primary, secondary, and high school students. The analysis results suggest that school and family environmental education is beneficial for improving students’ environmental knowledge and willingness to take environmental actions. Notably, the effect of school education is more substantial for cultivating environmental knowledge, whereas family education has a stronger impact on raising students’ willingness than school education. Students with higher levels of environmental knowledge are more likely to conduct pro-environmental behaviors only when they are willing to take environmental actions. If students are unwilling to act, higher environmental knowledge is negatively associated with the likelihood of pro-environmental behavior.

A Political Economy of Support for the Repression of the Business Elite,"Why do autocrats financially repress some allies but not others during an economic crisis? When too many foxes are in the henhouse, an autocrat may purge his allies in bad times and shrink the winning coalition. However, it is a risky enterprise. If he targets the wrong elite, it may backfire and trigger coups and dissent. Despite the high risk, we still do not know much about precisely who autocrats are likely to sideline from the ruling coalition. I suggest that the autocrat’s business allies are a politically expedient target during economic crises because the people perceive the co-opted business elite as corrupt. Given their low public popularity, the autocrat may justifiably blame the greedy business elite for the country’s economic woes. To develop a framework for public support for repression, I focus on Turkey as a case – a highly polarized country that has experienced a protracted financial crisis. One novel contribution of this study is the use of visual conjoints. I created fake LinkedIn profiles of hypothetical businesspeople with AI-generated profile pictures and business logos. I measured people’s support for their financial repression, depending on their firm’s characteristics, sectoral affiliations, and partisan attitudes toward the government’s economic policies. The results suggest that public support for financial coercion depends on the regime’s political economy. People are more likely to condone the extra-taxation of the business elite, who owe their success to the regime and are perceived as responsible for the economic crisis. This paper contributes to a growing scholarship on micro-level determinants of autocratic purges, and its findings have broad implications for our understanding of elite defection and autocratic power-sharing arrangements.",https://osf.io/zqcyt/,2023-09-13T19:33:26.303799,"['semuhi.sinanoglu@mail.utoronto.ca', 'Carolina']",OSF,

The majority of past research on AI and human decision-making has concentrated on model explainability and interpretability, with very little focus on understanding the impact of UQ on human-decision making performance. Moreover, UQ is often equated to the model’s predicted probability, hence, not carefully calibrated. In this work, we implemented instance-based UQ for three real datasets. To achieve this, we trained different AI models for classification for each dataset, and used random samples generated around the neighborhood of the given instance to create confidence intervals for UQ. The computed UQ was calibrated using a strictly proper scoring rule as a form of quality assurance for UQ. We then conducted two preregistered online behavioral experiments that compared objective human decision-making performance under different AI information conditions, including UQ. In Experiment 1 (N = 445), we compared decision-making for no AI (control), AI prediction alone, and AI prediction with a visualization of UQ. We found UQ significantly improved decision-making beyond the other two conditions. In Experiment 2 (N = 600), we focused on comparing different representations of UQ information: Point vs. distribution of uncertainty and visualization type (needle vs. dotplot). We did not find meaningful differences in decision-making performance among these different representations of UQ. Overall, our results indicate that human decision-making can be improved by providing UQ information along with AI predictions, and that this benefit generalizes across a variety of representations of UQ. Implementing instance-level UQ for AI may improve decision-making with real systems. Future work will explore additional representations and visualizations of AI UQ under different contexts to determine the best ways to provide this information to users for optimal decision-making with AI predictions.",https://psyarxiv.com/6syfv/,2023-09-13T19:12:10.538895,"['University of Texas', 'laura.m.cooper.civ@army.mil', 'jbakdash@gmail.com', 'University of Texas at Dallas', 'muratk@utdallas.edu', 'yan.zhou@utdallas.edu', 'Army']",OSF,

Perceivers attributed pain more often (β = .41, p &lt; .001) and higher intensities (β = 8.08, p &lt; .001) to White targets than Black targets.

Results: Although there were no differences for accuracy or non-attempt scores, the intervention group had higher independence scores compared to the business-as-usual control group. 
Conclusions and implications: The Maths For Life programme can help individuals with DS to improve their mathematical independence, evidence that supports further testing this programme in schools. Improving children’s independent application of mathematics is vital for everyday living.",https://psyarxiv.com/mzv7q/,2023-09-13T14:48:14.789718,['UK'],OSF,

A comprehensive understanding of the functional impairments within the brain associated with childhood who trauma histories, however, is unknown. Previous fMRI meta-analytical tools required homogeneity in task types and the clinical populations studied, thus, preventing the comprehensive pooling of brain-based deficits present in children who have trauma histories. We hypothesize that the use of the novel data-driven Bayesian author-topic model approach to fMRI meta-analyses will reveal deficits in brain networks spanning fMRI task types in children with trauma histories. We are the first known study to use the Bayesian author-topic model approach to fMRI meta-analyses within a clinical population. Using PRISMA guidelines, we present data-driven results obtained by combining activation patterns across heterogeneous tasks from 1,428 initially screened studies, thus combining data from 14 studies meeting study criteria (285 children with trauma histories; 297 healthy control children). Altered brain activity is revealed within two clusters in children with trauma histories as compared to control children: the Default Mode/Affective Network/posterior insula and Central Executive Network. Our identified clusters were associated with tasks pertaining to cognitive processing, emotional/social stress, self-referential thought, memory, unexpected stimuli and avoidance behaviours in youth who have experienced childhood trauma. Our results reveal disturbances in children with trauma histories within the modulation of DMN and CEN networks – but not the salience network- irrespective of also presenting post-traumatic stress symptoms.",https://psyarxiv.com/5uhp9/,2023-09-13T14:52:29.913368,"['BW', 'RIC', 'ND', 'State', 'IC', 'Cal', 'UK', 'BMC', 'm.klabunde@essex.ac.uk', 'PTS', 'HC', ' State', 'Central']",OSF,

The conjunction-bias between non-spatial (Color) and spatial Grouping cues over approximate number perception extends to Symmetry and Connectedness.,"Humans and animals share the cognitive ability to quickly extract approximate number information from sets. Main psychophysical models suggest that approximate numerosity relies on segmented units, which can be affected by Gestalt rules. Indeed, arrays with spatial grouping cues, such as connectedness, closure, and even symmetry, are underestimated compared to ungrouped arrays with the same low-level features. Recent evidence suggests that also non-spatial cues, such as color-similarity, trigger numerosity underestimation. However, in natural vision, several grouping cues may coexist in the same stimulus. Notably, conjunction of grouping cues (e.g., color + closure) reduces perceived numerosity following an additive rule. Here we investigated the effect of two Gestalt cues, connectedness and symmetry, over numerosity perception both in isolation and, critically, in conjunction with color. Participants performed a comparison-task between a reference and a test stimulus varying in numerosity. In Experiment 1, test stimuli contained two isolated groupings (connectedness or color-similarity), a conjunction (connectedness and color-similarity), and a neutral condition (no groupings). We found that the point of subjective equality (PSE) was higher in both isolated grouping conditions compared to the neutral condition. Importantly, in the conjunction condition, the biases from single grouping cues added linearly, resulting in a numerosity underestimation equal to the sum of the isolated biases. In Experiment 2 we found that conjunction of symmetry &amp; color followed the same rule. These findings strongly suggest that both spatial and non-spatial isolated cues affect numerosity perception. Crucially, we show that their conjunction-effect extends to Symmetry and Connectedness.",https://psyarxiv.com/e2x8c/,2023-09-13T14:29:24.003661,['andrea.adriano@hotmail.com'],OSF,

In general, people are more likely to notice when the unexpected object is similar to the attended items and dissimilar from the ignored ones. Perhaps surprisingly, current evidence suggests that this similarity effect results almost entirely from dissimilarity to the ignored items, and it remains unclear whether similarity to the attended items affects noticing. Other aspects of similarity have not been examined at all, including whether the similarity of the attended and ignored items to each other affects noticing of a distinct unexpected object. We used a sustained inattentional blindness task to examine all three aspects of similarity. Experiment 1 (n=813) found no evidence that increasing the similarity of the attended and ignored items to each other affected noticing of an unexpected object. Experiment 2 (n=610) provided some of the first compelling evidence that similarity to the attended items—in addition to the ignored items—affects noticing. Experiment 3 (n=1044) replicated that pattern and showed that noticing rates varied with the degree of similarity to the ignored shapes but not to the attended shapes, suggesting that suppression of ignored items functions differently from the enhancement of attended items.",https://psyarxiv.com/yxud4/,2023-09-13T14:30:59.808384,"['RIT', 'yifanding@gmail.com', 'USA', 'ND']",OSF,

From its inception, psychology used science to produce what was framed as incontrovertible “hard” evidence of racial hierarchy, infallible “proof” that white people (i.e., cismale, heteronormative, and economically resourced white people) were superior to Indigenous and Black people. We first trace the historical links between post-positivist epistemology and the ideology of white supremacy in psychological science, showing that although explicitly racist science (e.g., eugenics) has faded, the widely shared and strictly enforced epistemological norms about what is (and is not) “good” science remain entrenched. We then outline three epistemic imperatives to resist this harmful master narrative: 1) Embrace humanizing epistemologies, 2) Listen and learn from those who have been systematically left out of science, and 3) Recognize resistance as normative and necessary.

Building upon these findings, Experiment 2 specifically examined the interaction between autonomy and competence on declarative memory.

The students surveyed after COVID-19 are now taking face-to-face classes after a year or two of online-based learning experience. This study compares their learning outcomes to those of students who previously only had face-to-face classes. Owing to the statistical analyses, some points are clear. Final results after COVID-19 clearly show that student outcomes dropped. Attendance and quiz scores also drop slightly and lead to reduced scores in the final results. It can be inferred that students have lost their attitude to take on challenges without giving up as a whole. Moreover, report scores dropped significantly. The rate of decline is larger than attendance and quiz scores. The reports in the surveyed classes do not rely on a shallow understanding or investigation, so the decreasing may be serious. Losing opportunities to attend and participate in classes reduce self-management ability and opportunities for communication. Online classes do not provide sufficient opportunities to be exposed to different ideas, objectively reexamine their own ideas, and create new ideas of their own. These skills may have suffered serious decline. Ultimately, it all comes down to encouraging students to be spontaneous.

Socio-affective phenomena are known to play a prominent role at various levels of learning processes and outcomes, spanning high-order cognitive functions, motivation, sense of belonging, and quality of interaction with colleagues. Emotions, in particular, are nowadays considered dynamic and multifaceted phenomena that serve a wide range of adaptive functions. As a result, an interdisciplinary interest has recently emerged on ways by which computer-mediated learning environments may be endowed with emotional awareness, that is, information about one’s own emotions and/or the emotions of colleagues, which is instrumental to the learning task at hand. Emotion Awareness Tools are one such attempt to bestow learners with the possibility to produce and peruse emotional awareness through a dedicated interface that coexists with the overall learning environment. The thesis provides the details of the implementation and empirical assessment of an Emotion Awareness Tool with the following main characteristics. First, it is based on voluntary self-report of emotion. Second, it implements a computational structure of emotion rooted in appraisal theories of emotion, for which emotion elicitation and differentiation is a dynamic and ongoing process driven by a cognitive evaluation of the situation. Third, learners can produce and peruse emotional awareness through the tool on a moment-to-moment basis. Adopting an iterative design process, the implementation and assessment of the tool are guided by evidence gathered through empirical contributions aimed at investigating which factors – intrinsic to the tool, deriving from the interaction between learners and the tool, between learners themselves, as well as between learners and the instructional design – determine whether and how emotional awareness may be beneficial in computer-mediated learning environments. The main outcomes of the thesis are a toolbox that allows researchers and practitioners to configure an instance of the tool according to their own scientific or instructional goals, a structural causal model of the influence of emotional awareness on learning in computer-mediated environments, and methodological techniques or instruments that may be applied in similar contexts.",https://thesiscommons.org/myezb/,2023-09-13T10:52:28.195468,['RIT'],OSF,

Three web-based experiments manipulated the duration of the ambiguous word (200/500/800 ms) to also delineate the time-course of access to the different senses. The findings suggest that just like homonyms, the senses of irregular polysemes have separate representations that compete with each other for activation and slow semantic processing. For the other polysemes, there seems to be a single representation that acts as a gateway to the different senses (metonymic) or maps mainly onto the dominant, literal sense (metaphorical).

Past research has demonstrated that both carefully formed, contemplated attitudes, but also spontaneously elicited, automatic evaluations play a crucial role in guiding consumption choices. However, the accurate measurement of automatic product appraisals can be challenging because existing measures can assess automatic appraisals on single attribute dimensions only (e.g., ‘pleasant’/’unpleasant’). This limitation is critical because a) products are never unidimensional, and b) past research has demonstrated that the complex weighting of various product dimensions (e.g., price, taste, healthiness) often plays a crucial role in consumer decision making (Maehle, Iversen, Hem, &amp; Otnes, 2015). Here, we present the Implicit Attribute Classification Task (‘IMPACT’), a new measure of automatic product appraisals that, crucially, was designed specifically to reflect the multidimensionality of products by assessing automatic product appraisals of multiple product facets simultaneously. Following guidelines put forward by De Houwer et al. (2009), we thoroughly examine the IMPACT in terms of key features of automaticity. Across five experiments, we show that the appraisals measured by the IMPACT occur fast, in the absence of intention, and when cognitive resources are constraint.

Highly principled individuals and those with low social trust are particularly likely to reject compromising parties. Given the centrality of compromise in representative democracy, these findings suggest that political distrust may be a systemic component of representative democracy.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xyfzq/,2023-09-15T07:46:38.870158,[],OSF,

Out-of-school youth leads the global crisis of declining youth engagement. Past investigations linked the problem to apathy and that the out-of-school youth is an underserved sector without the means to activate their agency effectively. The advent of the 4th Industrial Revolution put in place new platforms where typologies of civic engagement are carried out, and there are external and internal factors that influence these. As the barangay reflects the larger Philippine society, this study examined the typologies of civic engagement that Filipino out-of-school youth participate in both in the traditional and non-traditional settings, the factors that influence their civic engagement participation, and their perceived significance of civic engagement. The study operated on a mixed-method design, which combined quantitative and qualitative research design elements to answer the research questions. The findings show that the modern youth manifested their intense participation in diverse social activities through digital civic engagement; they value civic engagement; they have a comprehensive understanding of what is happening around them; and they are conscious of their role and willing to do what they can to enrich their communities. To enhance the brewing potentials of their transformative character, existing public and private institutional mechanisms, programs, and networks must be strengthened and/or new ones created and explored geared towards fostering a more inclusive and healthy development of the out-of-school youth.

Aliran ini berasal dari daerah Surakarta dan didirikan pada tanggal 20 Mei 1949, oleh Soenarto Mertowerdojo. Yang Mengkliam dirinya telah mendapatkan wahyu oleh sang guru sejati sejak tanggal 14 Februari 1932 selama tujuh bulan berturut-turut dengan cara “Shalat daim” dan kemudian di kumpulkan dalam sebuah buku yang kemudian diberi nama “Sasangka Jati” yang artinya “Petunjuk Sejati” dan telah diterjemahkan dalam Bahasa Inggris dengan judul “True Light”. Pada tangggal 1954, pangestu memiliki 4 cabang, kemudian berkembang menjadi 96 cabang di tahun 1967, berkembang lagi menjadi 197 cabang di tahun 2005, dan menjadi 203 cabang di tahun 2010. (Suciati, 2014). Pada tahun 2014 pengikut pagestu berjumlah sekitar 200.000 anggota dan tersebar di seluruh cabang-cabang di Indonesia. Hal ini bisa demikian karena peran pengusung AKK (Aliran Kepercayaan Dan Kebatinan), yang  telah  mendapatkan    legitimasi dari  pemerintah  melalui  MK  (Mahkamah konstitusi) pada tahun 2017, dengan pernyatan mereka bahwa “Aliran Kepercayaan Dan Kebatinan di Indonesia tidak dianggap, sedangkan agama impor dan resmi, seperti  Islam, Kristen, Budha, Katolik, konguchu di akui dan  di  fasilitasi di negara ini, padahal Aliran  kepercayaan  Dan  Kebatinan  yang  merupakan agama  Nenekmoyang  yang subjeknya telah eksis dari dahulu”. AKK sebagai Agama yang sah di Indonesia tidak bisa dipandang ringan, adanya dikotomi istilah “Agama Asli” dan “Impor” menjadi tantangan  dakwah  umat  islam  untuk  bisa  hidup  damai  dengan  mereka,  maupun memahamkan terhadap masyarakat atas eksistensi AKK yang telah memisahkan diri dari Agama. Pasalnya ajaran pada aliran ini banyak memplagiatasi ajarannya maupun pemikirannya dari agama lain terkhusus agama islam, dan lebih parahnya telah menodai 
1ajaran agama islam yang murni, bahkan dengan agama yang lain juga demikian. Yaitu pada konsep manusia yang banyak dari ajarannya mengambil dari konsep-konsep agama Islam, dan Kristen. Contohnya pada hakikat manusia yaitu:  hakikat sejati manusia adalah tercapainya manusia atau bersatunya manusia dengan tuhan (Wahdatul Wujud). Hal ini tak bisa biarkan dan dianggap ringan, pasalnya walaupun Pangestu yang merupakan bagian dari Aliran Kepercayaan dan kebatianan dan telah terlindungi di dalam UUD 1945 pada Pasal 28 E ayat (1-2) dan dalam Pasal 22 UU HAM. Apa yang di percayai dan di ajarkan kelompok dan anggota ini jelas-jelas bertolak belakang dengan ajaran agama Islam dan Kristen, terkhusus agama Islam, kondisi yang demikian tentu tidak bisa diabaikan.

To investigate this, we collected self- and other-reports of autistic traits from university students, and tested them in an exploration task in which participants could learn the hiding patterns of multiple characters. Participants could freely change what character to engage with at any moment, providing information on what they explored and when. We quantified participants’ prediction errors and learning progress (i.e., the decrease in prediction error) with a hierarchical reinforcement learning model. We found that participants with lower scores on insistence-on-sameness and general autistic traits were less persistent, primarily relying on learning progress during the initial stages of exploration. Conversely, participants with higher scores were more persistent and relied on learning progress in later phases of exploration, resulting in better performance in the task.

Recognizing this fundamental right, ""The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act"" was enacted on April 1, 2010, to safeguard the educational rights of children aged 6 to 14. This study focuses on the implementation and awareness of these educational laws within the tea garden community of Dibrugarh District. To gather insights, we conducted surveys in six randomly selected tea gardens within the district, where we interviewed a diverse group of individuals including students, locals, members of the Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS), members of the All-Assam Tea Tribe Students Association, and teachers from state-run schools. The age range of the interviewees spanned from 6 to 57 years, and approximately 100 people were randomly interviewed from each tea garden. Our findings indicate that most children in the tea garden community have received education up to the primary level, typically until class 5, and expressed a strong desire to pursue further studies. While a handful of them managed to attend college and pursue bachelor's degrees, the majority did not have the opportunity to do so. It is worth noting that parents residing in the tea gardens were well aware of the significance of education for a better life and actively encouraged their children to pursue education to the best of their abilities. However, they lacked awareness of the specific laws and regulations about education, which resulted in missed opportunities for their children. By gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges and underlying reasons for the limited educational progress among children in the tea garden community, we are better equipped to devise and implement new laws and provisions that cater specifically to their needs. This research serves as a stepping stone towards improving educational opportunities and outcomes for the tea community, ultimately contributing to their overall development and well-being.",https://osf.io/zy72h/,2023-09-13T09:34:58.837328,[],OSF,

Identification of tissue specific histological marker is warranted to improve the diagnosis. Recent genetic study in CD identified association of ankyrin-G, which is a known protein that connects membrane bound E-cadherin with β2-spectrin in epithelial cells of the duodenal tissue.
Aims: We attempted to investigate the expression differences of ankyrin-G along with associated proteins namely E-cadherin and β2-spectrin in duodenal biopsy tissue of CD subjects compared to non-CD controls. 
Methods: Duodenal (D2 biopsy) tissue was collected from a total of 83 study participants, of which 50 were CD and 33 were non-CD controls. Whole RNA was isolated from available tissues from 32 CD and 23 non-CD controls and differential mRNA expression of ankyrin-G, E-cadherin and β2-spectrin were compared using real-time PCR. Tissue sections from 18 cases and 10 controls were subjected to immunostaining using specific monoclonal antibodies against ankyrin-G, E-cadherin and β2-spectrin. Tissue immunohistochemistry were evaluated for differential expression and pattern of expression of proteins.  
Results: RT-PCR revealed significant reduced expression of ankyrin-G (FC=0.63; p=0.005) and E-cadherin (FC=0.50; p=0.01) among CD subjects compared to non-CD controls. Tissue immunohistochemistry confirmed the reduced expression of ankyrin-G and E-cadherin in CD. Differential expression is grossly limited within outer columnar epithelial cell layer.
Conclusion: Reduced expression of two key cytoskeletal proteins (ankyrin-G and E-cadherin) were observed in CD. Reduced expression of ankyrin-G was previously reported in neurological diseases, whereas E-cadherin play critical role in neurological developments. Pathogenic role of these two proteins in CD suggests shared pathological determinants of CD and neurological disorders/conditions.

In our study, fifty participants responded to cues associated with different magnitudes of monetary values or electrical stimuli. Successful responses to those cues resulted in monetary gains (i.e., rewards) or omissions of electrical stimulation (i.e., relief), followed by a pleasantness rating scale. We also measured physiological arousal via skin conductance. As expected, we found that for reward and relief similarly, higher magnitudes elicited more successful responses, higher pleasantness ratings, and higher skin conductance responses. Moreover, differential reward/relief response patterns predicted later choices between reward and relief cues. These findings indicate that relief induced by threat omissions is functionally equivalent to receiving a reward, confirming that relief is a positive reinforcer for threat avoidance behaviors, which provides a new theoretical perspective on the learning process of active threat avoidance.",https://psyarxiv.com/tnhu4/,2023-09-13T07:36:41.853298,"['State', 'Cal', 'UK', 'SC', 'KU', 'USA', 'Brown', 'California', ' State', 'BC', 'Pitt']",OSF,

Given this limitation, we postulated that an artificial intelligence model could be developed to predict glioblastoma's presence based on genetic biomarkers found within blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Our medical literature analysis identified mutations within the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes as a prominent feature of glioblastoma (Yan et al., 2010). Subsequently, we leveraged the presence of mutations within IDH1 and IDH2 genes present in cerebrospinal fluid to develop an AI model using MATLAB programming language. We obtained publicly available data from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics on the varying mRNA expression levels of the mutated IDH1/2 and TP53 genes in each patient. These data served as the basis for training our decision tree model to predict the presence of glioblastoma. Our decision tree algorithm compared the percentages of mRNA expressed from each mutated gene, age, race, and sex to arrive at a diagnosis. Following the training of our AI model with 394 data points, we tested the results using 134 data points, achieving an accuracy rate of 97.74%. We expect that we could refine our AI model and improve its accuracy with more data points. We anticipate that by expanding the training data to include a broader range of cancer and precancer patients, we could improve our AI model's predictive capabilities. Ultimately, we believe that this technology has the potential to facilitate the early diagnosis of glioblastoma and other cancer types.",https://osf.io/ed85p/,2023-09-13T03:48:50.678756,[],OSF,

Despite the real consequences of support for violence, fairly little is known about such an extremist attitude outside studies of terrorism or aggression. Using a unique survey containing many psychological, political, and social characteristics, we find that perceived victimhood, authoritarianism, populism, and white identity are the most powerful predictors of support for violence, though military service, conspiratorial thinking, anxiety, and feelings of powerlessness are also related. These patterns suggest that subjective feelings about being unjustly victimized—irrespective of the truth of the matter—and the psychological baggage that accompanies such feelings lie at the heart of support for violence. We use these results to build a profile of characteristics that explain support for violence; the predictive validity of this profile is then tested by examining its relationship with support for the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, with which it is strongly associated, even accounting for support for Donald Trump. Our findings have implications for the detection of extremist attitudes and our understanding of the non-partisan/ideological foundations of anti-social political behavior.",https://psyarxiv.com/gbvy2/,2023-09-13T03:23:51.392344,"['mtarmaly@olemiss.edu', 'amende@louisville.edu', 'University of Mississippi', 'University of Louisville', 'University of Mississippi ', ' State', 'State']",OSF,

Evidence from machine learning suggests affective features may be embedded in the ecological statistics of the external environment but their causal role, if any, remains unclear. Here we provide evidence from machine and human observers that affective valence can be decoded directly from visual features. A visual valence (VV) model of low-level image statistics trained to predict Normative Valence (NV) in 8000 emotionally charged images transferred even more robustly to predicting valence of abstract paintings without conceptual content. Manipulating VV and availability of conceptual analysis, enhanced the contribution of VV to valence experience. In the brain, in contrast with NV, VV resided exclusively in early and mid-level visual areas. Employing a deep generative network, brain activity in these regions synthesized new images containing predicted positive versus negative VV. There are distinct competing modes determining valence experience, one indirectly from meaning, and the other derived from ecological visual statistics, affording direct perception of valence as an apparent objective property of the external world.",https://psyarxiv.com/he7px/,2023-09-13T01:19:20.803180,"['Weill Cornell Medicine', 'Cornell University']",OSF,

Unconditioned startle was positively associated with startle potentiation to the threat cue and the safety cue across both learning phases (CS+ Acquisition, CS- Acquisition, CS+ Extinction Training, CS- Extinction Training) and with fearful traits. Unconditioned SCR was positively associated with SCR to the CS+ and CS- and SCR difference score during Acquisition. Neither type of UCR was associated with PTSD symptom severity.

SOGIECE lack scientific evidence, misreport efficacy, and have significant methodological failings that inflict serious harms (increased depression, anxiety, and suicidality) and stigmatize the already vulnerable LGBTQIA+ community. Given cognitive-behavioral professionals’ (CBPs) commitment to developing and implementing only evidence-based treatments, they have an ethical duty to stand against SOGIECE, especially in a sociopolitical climate that is increasingly hostile toward LGBTQIA+ people globally. De-implementation is a systematic process focused on stopping routine use of an adverse – as in SOGIECE – or otherwise low-value practice. We analyzed and applied four key de-implementation phases that can aid in eliminating SOGIECE. These include: selecting scope of SOGIECE de-implementation efforts, assessing multilevel contextual barriers and facilitators to tailor de-implementation strategies, deploying active strategies, and evaluating selected strategies. Various examples of tailored strategies that address key barriers and facilitators to achieve maximum de-implementation success rates at the individual, organizational, policy, and social levels are outlined and discussed. While strategies needed to eliminate SOGIECE are complex, long-term, and multilevel, CBPs can help de-implement this practice.

To understand the reasons that drive these misconceptions, this study focuses on: identifying factors that impact family decisions about (not) raising autistic children bilingually; attitudes toward bilingualism expressed by the community, doctors, family members, and teachers; sources of information about bilingualism and autism available to families.
Methods: Through a mixed-method online survey, we explored these questions in 31 UK- based bilingual families with 34 autistic children (age M = 10.6 years; SD = 7.1).
Results: The families reported choosing bilingualism for their autistic child primarily so that the child can communicate with family and community members. Attitudes toward bilingualism in their networks were predominantly positive, with a large portion of individuals not having opinions possibly due to lack of information. Only about 1/3 of parents had access to information on bilingualism and autism, mostly found on the internet.

The rapidly growing art therapy literature claims that there is solid evidence that engaging with art ameliorates mental and physical disorders and increases wellbeing. This claim is used to justify numerous arts-based clinical interventions and health policies, so it deserves thorough scrutiny. Here we show that the evidence cited in favor of the efficacy of art therapy interventions is conceptually and methodologically flawed. Conceptually, experiments investigating the effects of arts-based interventions on health do not include appropriate tests nor control conditions that would allow demonstrating that the putative effects actually owe to the healing power of art: (i) they fail to define what art is, making it impossible to compare the effect of “art” and “non-art” stimuli and activities on health and wellbeing; (ii) they fail to demonstrate that “art” stimuli and activities elicit a distinct class of “art” experiences that modulate the mechanistic causes of disorders; (iii) and they fail to include causal manipulations of physiological processes believed to be mechanisms of action that could prove that art-induced processes affect the etiology of disorders. Methodologically, most studies cited as proof for the efficacy of art therapy lacked such common clinical trial procedures as defining the therapeutic agent, randomizing group assignment, controlling for patient or researcher allegiance, controlling for the effects of other concurrent interventions and medications, comparing art-based interventions to other kinds of interventions, or conducting and reporting statistical analyses appropriately. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence that art objects and activities can induce physiological changes to the human nervous system that result in health improvements and wellbeing.

Deterioration effects can occur in various domains, such as psychology, engineering, economics, ecology, and health.
In psychology, deterioration effects refer to the adverse or negative outcomes that may result from participating in psychotherapy. For example, some clients may experience increased distress, anxiety, depression, or suicidal thoughts after engaging in therapy. Some factors that may contribute to deterioration effects include the type and quality of therapy, the therapist-client relationship, the client’s expectations and motivation, and the client’s personal and social circumstances.
In engineering, deterioration effects refer to the degradation or damage of materials, structures, or systems due to various factors such as aging, wear and tear, corrosion, fatigue, erosion, or environmental conditions. For example, concrete structures may deteriorate due to cracking, spalling, carbonation, or chloride attack. Some methods to prevent or mitigate deterioration effects include proper design, maintenance, inspection, repair, or replacement.",https://osf.io/qfz7v/,2023-09-12T19:11:16.876022,"['AU', 'UT']",OSF,

Adapting two paradigms used with Western samples to measure social essentialism, we examined the development of essentialist beliefs about seven social categories (gender, race, nationality, religion, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and team fan bases) among 5-10-year-old children (N = 88) and adults (N = 273) in Iran, a population that is underrepresented in psychology research. Focusing on natural-kind reasoning, we investigated the relative contribution of biological perception of social categories, as well as cultural and motivational factors in the development of essentialist beliefs about these categories. Our findings suggest that biological perception of social categories plays a key role and that cultural and motivational factors become more relevant in essentialist reasoning about social categories that are not perceived as biologically marked. The developmental patterns of essentialist reasoning in our study also closely parallel those found in other cultures, namely the United States and Turkey, further suggesting the primary role of biological perception of social categories in natural-kind reasoning about the social world.",https://osf.io/7r9x6/,2023-09-12T18:54:37.693390,"['telli@bu.edu', 'University of Massachusetts', 'University of Massachusetts Amherst', 'University of Massachusetts Amherst ']",OSF,

However, the memorability of a stimulus can be quantified and partially predicted by a collection of conceptual and perceptual factors. Higher-level properties that represent the ‘meaningfulness’ of a visual stimulus to viewers best predict whether it will be remembered or forgotten across a population. Here, we hypothesize that the feelings evoked by an image, operationalized as the valence and arousal dimensions of affect, significantly contribute to the memorability of scene images. We ran two complementary experiments to investigate the influence of affect on scene memorability, in the process creating a new image set (VAMOS) of hundreds of natural scene images for which we obtained valence, arousal, and memorability scores. From our first experiment, we found memorability to be highly reliable for scene images that span a wide range of evoked arousal and valence. From our second experiment, we found that both valence and arousal are significant but weak predictors of image memorability. Scene images were most memorable if they were slightly negatively valenced and highly arousing. Images that were extremely positive or unarousing were most forgettable. Valence and arousal together accounted for only 6% of the variance in image memorability. These findings suggest that evoked affect contributes to the overall memorability of a scene image but, like other singular predictors, does not fully explain it. Instead, memorability is best explained by an assemblage of visual features that combine in perhaps unintuitive ways to predict what is likely to stick in our memory.",https://psyarxiv.com/grxdz/,2023-09-12T18:31:27.904982,"['cdw@columbia.edu', 'BC', 'Columbia University']",OSF,

In two cross-sectional surveys (N = 2133) collected on the first and second anniversary of the pandemic’s declaration (March 11, 2021 &amp; 2022), we used quantitative and qualitative methods to document people’s subjective experience of time: its phenomenology (subjective distance and speed of the passage of time) and evaluation of time emptiness and urgency (feelings of too much and too little time).

Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and post-GWAS analyses have shed light on the polygenic architecture of these diseases, enabling the use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for estimating an individual's relative genetic liability for presenting with the disease. PRS can screen and stratify individuals based on their genetic risk, potentially years or even decades before the onset of clinical symptoms. An emerging body of evidence from various research studies suggests that genetic susceptibility to late-onset neurodegenerative diseases might impact early life outcomes, including cognitive function, brain structure and function, and behaviour. This article summarises recent findings exploring the potential impact of genetic susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases on early life outcomes. A better understanding of the impact of genetic susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases early in life could be valuable in disease screening, detection, and prevention and inform treatment strategies before significant neural damage has occurred. However, ongoing studies have limitations.

Our paper illustrates this in the context of the Chinese publication system, where varying attention cycles coexist. In the Chinese state-run publication system, measured attention can be converted into public support, as well as increased subscription and submission revenue. Opportunities to assetize and convert attention and financial resources differ radically between English-language journals operating under Chinese control, China-based journals operating with international publishers, or Chinese-language journals. Using data from qualitative interviews with Chinese editors and publishers, we demonstrate how this conceptualization helps understand crucial differences between these journals, but also the specificity of the Chinese publishing system.

Fassung 2022) : Hydrodynamics and Dissolution - Influence of Hydrodynamics on Dissolution Rate of Poorly Soluble Drugs (rev. version 2022),"The objectives of the present study were to (1) examine both the hydrodynamics of compendial in vitro dissolution test apparatus as well as the respective in vivo gastrointestinal hydrodynamics in dogs, (2) describe the influence of hydrodynamics on the dissolution rates of poorly soluble drugs and (3) to develop a hydrodynamic based model to a priori predict dissolution rates of poorly soluble compounds. 

Hydrodynamics of compendial dissolution test apparatus (paddle and basket) were directly characterized by means of an ultrasound pulse echo method. Fluid velocities within the dissolution vessels correlated well and in a linear manner with the rotational speed (rpm) of both the paddle and basket test apparatus, respectively. Thus, based on this correlation, it was possible to calculate velocities of the dissolution media at any rotational speed. Fluid velocities were determined using the basket method to range between 0.3 and 5 cm/s (25 to 200 rpm) and for the paddle method to range between 1.8 and 37 cm/s. These fluid velocity data, determined empirically here for the first time in compendial dissolution vessels, are a prerequisite to forecast drug substance dissolution rates in vitro. In order to calculate such mass transfer rates the so called ""Kombinations-Modell"" was developed. This model is based on the convective diffusion theory by V.G. Levich. Here, we applied it on coarse and micronized felodipine powders as drug substance models as well as on oxygen as a model / vector to study hydrodynamics independent of chemical nature or state of aggregation. As a result, predicted dissolution rate data, calculated by means of the combination model, were found to correspond well with the respective dissolution rates determined by experiment. As expected, hydrodynamics did not discriminate between different states of aggregation of the two model compounds oxygen (gas) and felodipine (solid). Using the paddle method Reynolds numbers from Re=2292 to Re=31025 were calculated. In contrast, Reynolds numbers determined using the basket apparatus ranged from Re=231 to Re=4541. With respect to changes in hydrodynamic conditions particles of coarse grade felodipine were found to be more sensitive than micronized material of the same chemical species. 

A scintigraphic method was established to modulate intestinal hydrodynamics and to subsequently study gastric emptying and intestinal transit of caloric and non-caloric fluids in labradors. For orally administered solutions time needed for total gastric emptying (GE&gt;95%) was found to depend on both volume and caloric content. GE&gt;95% for 200 ml of 20 % aqueous glucose solution differed significantly (278 min.) from GE&gt;95% for the same volume of 0.9 % sodium chloride solution (97 min.). After administration of 20 % glucose solution the mean duodeno-jejunal transit rate (MTR) was determined to be 2.7 cm/min. This was significantly different from measured MTR after administration of the same volume of 0.9 % sodium chloride solution (1.1 cm/min.). However, duodeno-jejunal transit itself was found not to correlate with gastric emptying. Gastro-intestinal flow rates (= flow influenced also by gastric emptying) were determined using an aspiration method. After administration of 200 ml of 20 % glucose solution gastro-intestinal flow rates reached (short time) maxima  from 20 to 60 ml/min. (median: 8.3 ml/min.). In contrast, gastro-intestinal flow rates were found to be significantly higher following administration of 200 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride solution, exhibiting (short lasting) maxima of up to 100 ml/min. (median: 35.0 ml/min.). Luminal dissolution rate of felodipine was found to be greater following coadministration of hypertonic (!) glucose than following coadministration of 0.9 % saline. This result correlated well with an increased intestinal fluid volume (collected 76 cm distal to the pylorus) following oral administration of 20 % glucose solution.",https://osf.io/xc3nj/,2023-09-12T17:40:50.038774,[],OSF,

We call these recurring, self-organized states emotions. Emotions display many of the hallmark features of self-organized attractor states, such as hysteresis (prior events influence the current state), degeneracy (many configurations of the underlying variables can produce the same global state), and stability. Because most bodily, neural, and environmental affordances are shared by all humans–we all have cardiovascular systems, cerebral cortices, and caregivers who raised us–similar emotion states emerge in all of us.

End-of-compulsory school performance accounted for 1% to 20% of the variance across occupational, financial, and social-emotional outcomes in emerging adulthood. Educational attainment attenuated these associations only slightly, with school grades at age 16 accounting for variance in emerging adulthood outcomes independent of later educational attainment. We found that school grades were equally predictive for boys’ and girls’ outcomes. In children from lower family socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, school grades were more predictive of their educational attainment, financial attitudes, and anxiety compared to higher SES children, with varying effect sizes (i.e., 0.3% to 4.2%).

Using an agent-based model of recycling in surface contexts, this study looks how the archaeological record changes under different conditions of recycling frequency, occupational intensity, mobility, and artifact selection. The simulations also show that while an increased number of recycled artifacts across a landscape does indicate the occurrence of more scavenging and recycling behaviors generally, the location of large numbers of recycled artifacts is not necessarily where the scavenging itself happened. This is particularly true when mobility patterns mean each foraging group spend more time moving around the landscape. The results of the simulations also demonstrate that recycled artifacts are typically those that been exposed longer in surface contexts, confirming hypothesized relationships between recycling and exposure. In addition to these findings, the recycling simulation shows how archaeological record formation due to recycling behaviors is affected by mobility strategies and selection preferences.

Several R packages have been developed that implement different Bayesian estimation approaches for graphical modeling in R.

From this, we derive an ADV+ADJ construction as originated in this paper, such as \textit{very consistent} or \textit{logically consistent}. Here, the former collocation is called the scalar ADV+ADJ construction, and the latter non-scalar ADV+ADJ construction since instead of foregrounding the degree of an adjective, it signifies a \textit{consistent} relationship in \textit{logic}. Although structurally, an adverb modifies an adjective in such a non-scalar ADV+ADJ construction, this particular construction implies the categorical relationship. This mismatch has led to research on the non-scalar ADV+ADJ construction from semantics and L2 acquisition perspectives. While explanatorily adequate, previous research has seldom covered how Chinese learners of English perceive and use this unique construction. We assume that this particular construction might confuse Chinese ESL when an adjective collocates with an adverb that seems unusually semantically compatible with the adjective. We, therefore, explore the usage difference of this construction between native English speakers and Chinese ESL. Analysis of two corpora of SCI papers between native English speakers and Chinese ESL showed that NS employed this construction more frequently, precisely, and with richer variety than Chinese ESL.

Evidence suggests tasks like childcare and domestic work fell disproportionately on mothers during the pandemic, with consequences for their wellbeing. We explore how the pandemic affected emotional and practical support available to mothers between March and August 2020 and whether changes in support are associated with changes in their paid work and mental health. Data were collected in August 2020 from 1528 UK and US mothers with at least one child under 5-years using a cross-sectional survey and are analysed using regression models. Women’s in-person contact with support networks decreased, while virtual interactions increased. Most mothers experienced a ‘nuclearization’ of in-person support: childcare from fathers and siblings increased or remained constant but decreased from the grandparental generation. Women receiving less support during the pandemic had higher odds of reducing participation in paid work. Associations between support and mental health are limited. We also identify women who concurrently experienced reduced support and increased need for help, representing a particularly vulnerable group. The nuclearization of maternal social networks likely increased physical and emotional pressures on the immediate family, risking parental burnout and affecting reductions in female participation in paid labour. There is a need for reliable and affordable childcare options that help reduce women’s burden of unpaid care labour, allowing them to re-enter (or remain in) paid labour.",https://osf.io/ne2kv/,2023-09-12T11:11:10.364833,"['SU', 'Williams', 'State', 'Cal', 'UK', 'BMC', 'USA', 'Brown', 'UP', ' State']",OSF,

Accordingly, transgender youth have relatively low care satisfaction and high treatment drop-out, further exacerbating extant mental health inequities. To reduce these inequities, mental health providers need knowledge and skills to enhance transgender youth’s treatment engagement and benefits. However, a comprehensive set of practices addressing the needs of transgender youth patients and their providers does not exist. Thus, the current study developed the Gender Affirming Psychotherapy (GAP) intervention.
Methods: GAP was developed using human-centered design, a methodological approach for creating interventions that prioritizes the needs of key stakeholders, which in this study included mental health providers, transgender youth, and their parents. A scoping review of the literature and stakeholder focus groups were conducted to identify GAP, which encompasses core principles and skills to enhance mental health services for transgender youth.
Results: GAP encompasses 26 principles and 39 skills, organized within 10 domains. All principles and skills were designed to be relevant for various provider types (e.g., psychiatrists, social workers) and to be flexibly adapted to meet diverse patient needs.
Conclusions: GAP offers a scalable and flexible approach to addressing the growing mental healthcare needs of transgender youth.

A disease's presence or severity can be determined objectively by biomarkers, which are then used to monitor, diagnose, and track the development of a disease. There are several different categories of biomarkers that have been identified for neurodegenerative diseases, including genetic, epigenetic, protein, imaging, and behavioral biomarkers. These biomarkers can be utilised separately or in combination to assist the development of targeted therapeutics by providing a better knowledge of the underlying illness process.

By considering connections between entities in a graph, GNNs are able to extract valuable insights. One notable variation of GNN is the graph attention network (GAT), which employs the attention mechanism and has demonstrated promising performance in various applications. However, its ability to incorporate feature information from nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood is limited, leading to degraded performance on heterophilic data. To address this limitation, this thesis proposes a novel attention-based model, namely the Directional Graph Attention Network (DGAT). This model combines the feature-based attention with the global directional information extracted from the graph topology, as inspired by the Directional Graph Network (DGN). A new class of Laplacian matrices is proposed and an existing theoretical result on DGN is extended. This extension bridges a gap in the literature. The experimental results presented in the thesis, based on nine real-world benchmarks and ten synthetic data sets, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DGAT model compared to the GAT baseline model. Particularly on heterophilic data sets, DGAT showed a notable average increase of approximately 35% in node classification tasks across all heterophilic real-world data sets. In addition, DGAT outperforms GAT by an average margin of around 51% in all ten synthetic data sets with various levels of heterophily.",https://thesiscommons.org/fvnh6/,2023-09-12T04:14:37.448602,[],OSF,

It delves into the challenges faced by healthcare providers, explores the benefits of advanced scheduling algorithms, and showcases real-world examples of successful implementations. Moreover, it highlights the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning in revolutionizing healthcare scheduling. Appointment scheduling is a common and important task in many domains, such as education, healthcare, business, and social networking. It involves organizing and optimizing the allocation of time slots for multiple individuals, taking into account various constraints such as availability, preferences, and dependencies. For example, a doctor may need to schedule appointments for patients based on their urgency, availability, and medical history; a teacher may need to schedule exams for students based on their academic performance, preferences, and deadlines; a manager may need to schedule meetings for employees based on their roles, projects, and availability.
Computational methods that can automate and improve this process are called appointment scheduling algorithms.

Method. Fifty-two individuals (76.9% female; 84.6% white) who had experienced a Criterion A trauma participated in the two-week study and reported their PA and PTSD symptom levels five times a day at two-hour intervals (M surveys completed = 60.4). Multi-level and regularized individual-only network models were generated using vector autoregression. 
Results.  Feeling distant from others was the PTSD symptom most closely connected to lower positive affect; it was also the most connected to other PTSD symptoms. PA items did not predict lower PTSD at the next time point, except for one bidirectional relationship. Feeling on edge was the symptom with the largest magnitude of relationships to other symptoms in the multilevel network, but this was only reflected in 38.5% of the individual networks. Three example individual networks are described and discussed for clinical implications. 
Conclusions.  We did not find evidence to support the hypothesis that PA buffers PTSD symptom severity on the time scale assessed (2 hours).

In the present research, we provide evidence for a novel account of the social function such metaethical judgements play in expressing tolerance or intolerance of disagreement. We propose that, in virtue of this, taking metaethical stances has distinct reputational implications in different contexts where the social implications of signaling tolerance or intolerance differ. Our account provides a more cohesive and unified explanation of existing findings than previous accounts. In Study 1, we find that, compared to objectivists, relativists are perceived as more tolerant, empathic, to have superior moral character, and to be more desirable as social partners. In Study 2, we replicate these findings with a within-participants design and also show that, despite these reputational costs, objectivists are perceived as more morally serious. In Study 3, using a novel pretested database of moral issues, we examine evaluations of people who expressed objectivism or relativism concerning concrete moral issues, in situations where the person either agreed or disagreed with the counterpart’s views about these issues. This study replicated our prior results and demonstrated that the effects sometimes differed substantially across conditions of agreement and disagreement and across different moral issues. These results suggest that there are important social implications to expressing different metaethical stances in different contexts, and that sensitivity to these implications may explain the observed variation in metaethical judgements.",https://psyarxiv.com/62z8c/,2023-09-11T16:46:50.582397,"['Cornell University', 'dm@gmail.com', 'Harvard University', ' State', 'State']",OSF,

Category feedback, however, is often non-deterministic (e.g., by 25% chance untrue a.k.a. probabilistic feedback) rendering experiences as somewhat unreliable. In probability learning and economic decisions (when humans try to predict which of two outcomes is more rewarding), it is often observed that humans decide non-rational (probability matching, Gamblers Fallacy). Despite shared origins, the research areas of category learning, probability learning, conditioning and economic decisions (experience based) did not arrive at a consensus of what drives such probability matching strategies. Here, we offer a domain-general integrative model that predicts the mixture of behavioral trends when participants learn probabilistic stimulus-outcome regularities. We use the Category Abstraction Learning framework (CAL), implementing the hypothesis, that humans count the streak of events, and generate simple rules and conditional hypotheses with them. We present simulations of four studies, one from each domain, showing that CAL’s learning mechanisms accurately predict systematic and individual differences in category (correlation) learning, reward learning, risky gambles, and fear conditioning, concerning the phenomena of Gamblers Fallacy, positive and negative recency, or win-stay-lose-shift strategies, in a single model. One central novel CAL hypothesis to link learning phenomena under gains, losses and neutral feedback, is that gains and losses differently affect cognitive control during learning (corrective feedback processing), thereby also providing a novel perspective on risk-preferences in experience-based risky gambles. We discuss CAL’s potential as a domain-general account of human learning in experience-based decisions in light of a broader range of theories from multiple domains.",https://psyarxiv.com/h4nu6/,2023-09-11T16:06:54.234157,"['IU', 'NIU', 'r.schlegelmilch@uni-bremen.de', 'ND']",OSF,

Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), to investigate cortical hemodynamics related to freezing in freely moving people. 
METHODS: We measured fNIRS activity over multiple motor-related cortical areas in 23 persons with Parkinson’s disease who experienced daily freezing (“freezers”) and 22 age-matched controls during freezing-provoking tasks including turning and doorway passing, voluntary stops, and actual freezing. Crucially, we corrected fNIRS signals for confounds of walking. We first compared cortical activity between freezers and controls during voluntary stops and during freezing-provoking tasks without freezing. Secondly, within the freezers, we compared cortical activity between freezing, stopping, and freezing-provoking tasks without freezing. 
RESULTS: Here, we provide new evidence suggesting that freezing results from an oversensitivity to stopping signals and a disbalance between the SMA and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), areas known for their role in inhibiting actions. First, we show that freezing-provoking tasks (without freezing) resemble cortical activity during stopping in both groups, with the freezers displaying higher activity in the SMA and premotor cortex than controls during freezing-provoking tasks.  Secondly, we show that, during actual freezing events, activity in the PFC was lower than during voluntary stopping.
CONCLUSION: We extend upon the current role of the SMA in freezing pathophysiology by postulating that freezing results from a paroxysmal imbalance between the SMA and the PFC within the stopping network.",https://osf.io/uvazs/,2023-09-11T15:27:47.759641,['helena.cockx@radboudumc.nl'],OSF,

In a study with a longitudinal design, we demonstrated the test-retest reliability of the VoPE scale and its ability to forecast physical activity and exercise behavior. Finally, psychometric network analysis and elastic net regression indicated that the VoPE scale covers a unique content area and makes novel contributions to the prediction of sports behavior.

One such phenomenon, relevant to a variety of learning tasks, is stimulus generalization. Here, we compare generalization gradients often taken to betray cognitive processes of learning, and test how much they depend on how they are assessed. We compared generalization following predictive and category learning, while manipulating two features of the testing procedure that commonly differ between domains (test framing and test format). First, participants learned how to discriminate two continuous stimuli in two outcomes (categorization A vs. B or outcome prediction A vs. No A). During generalization test, we either presented repeated decisions or probability ratings (test format) for the whole range of stimuli. Further, we either framed the task as relative competition between both response alternatives or as absolute estimate on a single-outcome (test framing). The results suggest that both test factors influence the shape of the generalization gradients in both domains. Framing seemed to influence response rules, while response format affected response determinism. We argue that the same learning mechanisms underlie category learning and predictive learning, and discuss how taking the methods of testing generalization into account can help arriving at a general theory of human learning.",https://psyarxiv.com/eakwz/,2023-09-11T12:19:11.386462,"['IU', 'NIU', 'r.schlegelmilch@uni-bremen.de']",OSF,

Whilst PoTS is associated with impaired daily functioning, burdensome fatigue and poor quality of life, little research has been undertaken to examine how patients attempt to share their debilitating, daily symptom experiences with others. The current study therefore employed narrative analysis to explore how people with PoTS communicated understandings of their chronic illness within the re-telling of their own diagnostic stories. Method: A purposeful sample of 20 YouTube vlogs, triangulated alongside semi-structured interviews of 15 people diagnosed with PoTS (Mean Age= 35.3, SD= 12.1), were coded through NVIVO. The conduct of narrative analysis was guided through the adoption of a performative approach (Meraz et al., 2019). Rigour was achieved through reflexive note generation, numerous team analysis discussions and data triangulation. Findings: Within their narratives, storytellers constructed and drew upon socio-medical frameworks- those surrounding the autonomic nervous system- to communicate understandings of their PoTS to others and to account for their widespread symptom experiences. Through these models, storytellers depicted experiencing symptoms as a heightened bodily awareness, through the portrayal of their PoTS as a perceived ‘disruption’ to their body’s unconscious pathways.

Despite the importance of this developmental period, relatively little is known about the emergence and development of response inhibition, a form of inhibitory control, and the associated neural substrates across this key transition. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), an optical imaging technique suitable for imaging the developing brain, and an age-appropriate response inhibition task, we investigated the brain regions associated with response inhibition in 16-month-old toddlers. This pre-registered study extends our previous work with 10-month-old infants (Fiske et al., 2022)as it follows the same cohort of participants, now at 16-months of age. Whilst our previous work demonstrated that 10-month-old infants recruited right-lateralised regions of the PFC and parietal cortex when inhibition was required, the current study suggests that by 16-months, toddlers recruit the left superior parietal gyrus, the right inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral regions of the dorsolateral PFC and orbital frontal cortex. Although there was no longitudinal change in response inhibition performance, more widespread, bilateral regions of the PFC were recruited during response inhibition at 16-months compared to 10 months. We acknowledge the need for replication of these results. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that the transition from infancy to toddlerhood may constitute an important period of reorganisation of the PFC that might support the development of early inhibitory control processes.",https://psyarxiv.com/w7mkq/,2023-09-11T10:19:20.290048,['abigail.fiske@psy.ox.ac.uk'],OSF,

However, and to our knowledge, attempts to validate this possibility have remained inconclusive so far, and results remain focused on offline behavioral decisions made after stimulus appearance. In the present paper, we present an eye-tracking protocol for exploring the cognitive processes preceding behavioral responses in an interval comparison task, where participants viewed two consecutive intervals and had to decide whether it speeded up (first interval longer than second) or slowed down (second interval longer). Our main concern was disentangling oculomotor responses to the visual stimulus itself from correlates of duration-relate to judgements. To achieve this, we defined three consecutive time windows based on critical events: baseline onset, onset of the first interval, onset of second interval, end of stimulus. We then extracted traditional oculomotor measures for each (number of fixations, pupil size), and focused on time-window-related changes to separate the responses to the visual stimulus from those related to interval comparison per se. As we show in the illustrative results, eye-tracking data showed significant differences that were consistent with behavioral results, raising hypotheses on the mechanisms engaged.

Women gained more approval for high education and income than men, and men lost more approval for low income and occupational status than women. In countries with conservative gender norms, these differences were stronger – men also lost more approval for low educational status as conservative gender norms increased.

However, about half of the country’s active population remains in agriculture. In order to characterize
the role of agriculture and livestock in Vietnam’s structural transformation, we assess ongoing
dynamics at three complementary scales: national, sectoral (agriculture and livestock) and local
(district of Bavi). We show that the transition since Doi Moi (Renovation) has given rise to a political
economy that provides incentives to industries and services. However, labor abundance (due to
population density) and limited land availability (85% of agricultural land is composed of less than 1
ha farms) have slowed the canonical structural transformation, and widened income inequality
between agriculture and non-agricultural workers. In this ‘Lewis trap’ context, intensive livestock (as it
is the case for aquaculture and horticulture) has played a significant role in increasing labor and land
productivity, offering some perspectives to secure smallholder agricultural systems. But the
emergence of those very intensive systems producing a lot of effluents has in the same time
jeopardized sustainable development of rural and peri-urban areas. More recently, the political shift
towards industrial corporate agriculture and large-scale farming has increased this pressure on the
environment, and endangered inclusive agricultural development. Today, smallholder farming and
rural communities encounter many challenges to exploit resources efficiently and gain access to input

including Vietnam’s. The need for information systems is now necessary in every
enterprise. Most of published studies on information systems have been conducted
in developed countries, with little in developing or less developed countries. From
those few, there was no one focusing in Vietnam.
Aims. This thesis examines the experiences of seven Vietnamese small and
medium enterprises when they adopted information systems. The authors
investigated the reasons for, the process of, and the factors influencing
information system adoption.
Methods. The qualitative research method was used to answer research questions.
Semi-structured interviews were used as the data collection tool to explore
participants’ experiences. Content analysis of the interview transcripts was used to
extract answers given during the semi-structured interviews and to identify new
themes that emerged from the data. The participants’ experiences were compared
to what has been reported in the existing literature.
Results. The analysis resulted in important findings. It confirmed some reasons
and factors found in the literature concerning information system adoption in
Vietnamese small and medium enterprises. Despite some similarities, the authors
found some differences, such as government role, concerning the information
system adoption.",https://osf.io/qty43/,2023-09-11T06:05:53.158395,"['SC', 'UNI', 'IU', 'ND', 'ENC']",OSF,

driving the country’s process of trade liberalization since the 1980s. Vietnam provides an
important case for the study of the politics of trade policy, as its rapid transformation from
isolation to active trade player has been one of the most dramatic of any country. As a
developing country, such trade agreements require costly and highly politically sensitive
policy reforms. Moreover, as a country with a one-party socialist political system, its
capacity to engage with the capitalist global and regional trade regimes is less than for
many of its peers. This situation raises questions about how and why Vietnam has so
rapidly adopted a strategy of aggressive trade liberalization through bilateral, regional and

central government and with the participation of the local governments, private sector and grassroots
people in the framework of the GMS Program. So far there has been no major research either in Vietnamese
or English that addresses this issue. The thesis seeks to fill this gap by examining the empirical process of
regionalisation in three Vietnam’s border towns in the First-Generation GMS Economic Corridor Town
Development Project. Employing analytical framework based on relevant International Relations and
interdisciplinary theories, and a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, the thesis finds that the GMS
regionalisation is a combination of ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ processes. The thesis commences by
highlighting the significance of the Mekong River to the development of the region. Then various multilateral
cooperative schemes are explored to generate a complete picture of regional cooperation. It is concluded
that many multilateral mechanisms with little progress may have negative impacts on the regionalisation in
the GMS. Among 13 schemes in the GMS, GMS Program is considered as one of the most well-known
subregional cooperation schemes. The GMS Program came to existence just in time to assist the Mekong
riparian states to integrate better into the regional and international markets in the context that there were
new developments both at the regional and world’s levels. In the case of Vietnam, the GMS Program has
given Hanoi an option to carry on its omni-directional foreign policy and helped it consolidate its existing
relationships with its traditional and neighbouring partners. Notably, regionalisation is occurring in some
parts of the country where GMS projects have been implemented. Regionalisation can be best observed in
economic space where there are intensive interactions among people under various dimensions enabled
by favourable policies. Although regionalisation promises to bring new cooperative opportunities in the
GMS, regionalisation in the GMS will continue to meet new challenges from growing natural and man-made
threats to the Mekong River. Further, the involvement of outsiders is also a real challenge to the regionbuilding
process.",https://osf.io/rsw7c/,2023-09-11T05:54:25.670422,[],OSF,

However, the performance and dependability of engine components tend to deteriorate over their operational lifespan. This degradation adversely affects their reliability and overall efficiency. To proactively address maintenance requirements and mitigate the risk of engine failure, accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) becomes imperative. Precise estimation of RUL empowers effective maintenance planning, minimizing potential risks and reducing downtime caused by engine malfunctions. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is a Deep Learning technique that is widely used for predicting accurate RUL as LSTM are capable of learning long-term dependencies which can be useful in the case of large data-driven predictions. This paper proposes an LSTM model with LSTM, dropout, and fully connected layers for predicting the RUL of Aircraft Turbofan Engines using the CMAPSS turbofan Jet engine degradation dataset provided by NASA. The primary architecture of the proposed model has four layers of LSTM and Dropout each and a fully connected layer for output, with tanh, sigmoid, and relu as primary activation functions. The C-MAPSS dataset consists of four each training and testing datasets. Datasets consisting of 26 features including Engine id, Number of cycles, Operational settings, and Sensor data are pre-processed and brought down to relevant features with the help of a correlation matrix. Further, the dataset is transformed according to the window size of the LSTM model, which makes it easy to use it for training. Undergoes training and testing on pre-processed sub-datasets, and the obtained results are compared against existing methods that have used the same dataset in their research work. The performance evaluation of this model is conducted based on root mean squared error and score function values.",https://osf.io/vgmj9/,2023-09-11T08:10:46.524249,"['RU', 'UL']",OSF,

When trying to localize moving objects this is problematic, as an object will have moved on by the time its position has been determined. Here, we consider predictive motion extrapolation as a fundamental delay-compensation strategy employed by the brain. From a population-coding perspective, we outline how extrapolation can be achieved by a forwards shift in the ‘population position estimate’ – the represented position of an object, encoded in distributed neural activity. We identify three general mechanisms underlying such shifts, involving asymmetries in excitation, inhibition, and connectivity. We consider specific examples in different visual regions, as well as how motion extrapolation can be achieved during inter-regional signaling, and how asymmetric connectivity patterns which support extrapolation can emerge spontaneously from local synaptic learning rules. Finally, we consider how more abstract ‘model-based’ predictive strategies might be neurally implemented. Overall, we present a general framework for understanding how the brain determines the real-time position of moving objects, despite neural delays.",https://psyarxiv.com/tkg3f/,2023-09-11T01:17:42.345388,"['The U', 'UT', 'w.turner@qut.edu.au']",OSF,

However, when the actual content does not match the expectation, costly reanalysis processes are required. Previous work has suggested that experience with unexpected syntactic structures reduces such repair costs, a phenomenon referred to as syntactic adaptation or updating. However, other studies have failed to replicate these effects. We investigated (a) whether there was syntactic updating at the group level and whether it persisted over time; and (b) whether there were stable individual differences in syntactic ambiguity resolution and cognitive abilities that could potentially lead to individual variation in syntactic updating. Participants were exposed to different distributions of expected and unexpected completions of temporarily ambiguous sentences and tested on whether that experience changed their processing of unexpected sentence structures. They completed two sessions, one week apart enabling us to examine the stability of individual differences. Participants also completed assessments of cognitive abilities and extent of language experience. At the group level, we did not observe any significant syntactic updating. At the individual level, we found that syntactic ambiguity resolution was stable within a session but not across sessions. Individual differences in cognitive abilities and language experience did not correlate with syntactic ambiguity resolution or updating. These results suggest as-yet-unexplained fluctuation in individuals’ syntactic processing that could contribute to lack of replication of syntactic effects.

Spenser’s superb creative skills profoundly influenced his contemporaries and the English poets of later generations. Nevertheless, the translation of Spenser’s sonnets began exceedingly late in China with few results. Guided by the horizon of expectation in reception aesthetics, this study compared Cao Minglun and Hu Jialuan’s versions of Amoretti Sonnet 67 (Amoretti 67) based on their content, rhyme, and language style. The main question is to understand what horizons of expectations Hu and Cao’s translations reflect based on reception aesthetics, and how do Hu and Cao’s horizons fuse with the original author’s horizon of expectation? Guided by translators’ vision of expectation, Hu emphasized that both the content and style of the translation should be faithful to the original text. Thus, Hu’s translation is the closest to the original poem. Contrarily, Cao’s translation sought a balance between the original text and the translation. Cao aimed to maintain the content and format of the original poetry while capitalizing on the strengths of the Chinese language. Both Chinese versions embody their translator’s values. The significance of this study extends to its implications for Chinese readers delving into Spenser’s poetic world.

Unlike Wordsworth, who worshipped nature, Robert Frost presented man as the focal point in most of his poems; his treatment of nature was a mixed feeling – both a sense of awe and mysticism. Man, nature, and environment are the three issues that come under repeated scrutiny in most of his poems, where he explores the effect of man on his environment and vice-versa. His portrayal of the situation where human beings grapple their way out patiently in their disagreeable mood – makes it more relevant in today’s context. Robert Frost reveals man – the nature dichotomy, the interrelationship between them to strike tragic depths though not communicative but always at loggerheads. This poem under study stretches afar and meanders into a quintessential search for truth and problems confronting man pitted against nature. The main aim of this article is to unravel his ambivalent views of nature, human character, and the mutual interrelationship between them with a specific focus on the poem “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening” which, expresses profound clarification on human experience against the backdrop of nature. What is Robert Frost’s understanding of nature? Why is man endlessly confronting with nature/surroundings? Does man’s inner strength have any role to play are some of the questions that seek to find out in this study.

In a universe dominated by the second law of thermodynamics, entropy - the inherent tendency towards disorder - is an inescapable constant. However, life, in its essence, challenges this tendency, maintaining order and complexity through free energy. This energy, especially human energy, is not only the vital force that sustains biological processes but is also the primary energy source that fuels the complex structures and operations of contemporary societies. For 95% of humanity's historical time, human energy was channeled very differently than it is today. It was primarily directed towards group cohesion, life sustenance, and maintaining balance with the surrounding environment. Life in small cohesive groups allowed for a balanced use of energy, resisting entropic forces. However, with the transition to post-agricultural societies, there was a drastic shift in how this energy is utilized. The demands of modern society, with its emphasis on production, transportation, marketing, and consumption, require an unprecedented amount of human energy. This energy is extracted from individuals. This essay seeks to explore this dynamic, questioning the diversion of human energy from its primary purpose and the need to realign our societies to recognize the intrinsic value of human energy in the form of labor. In an entropic universe, where disorder is the norm, human energy is our greatest defense against chaos. Therefore, it is imperative that we recognize its centrality in our lives and societies.

We documented mass polarization over whether the judicial reform presents a threat to democracy and examined its predictors. We found evidence that different types of polarization are related, but distinct constructs. Specifically, issue-based, affective, and perceived societal polarization are differentially predicted by trust in democratic institutions (i.e., government, judiciary, and media), constructive patriotism, and social identity. Constructive patriotism and trust in institutions predicted issue-based and affective polarization, whereas social identity predicted only issue-based polarization. These effects vary across pro- and anti-reform individuals. Perceived societal polarization was predicted by generalized trust and universalism/benevolence values across the polarized camps. These types of polarization differentially predicted downstream consequences of polarization–conflict management attitudes, acts of, and responses to, civil protests, and outgroup attitudes.

We interviewed 14 autistic students at a public university in the United States as part of a larger project to understand the campus climate for autistic students. Participants were interviewed either in groups or individually via Zoom, or asynchronously over email. We used Reflexive Thematic Analysis to identify patterns of meaning across the dataset and provide a theoretically informed interpretation of autistic college students’ access to information about resources and opportunities. We constructed two themes related to the difficulties autistic students face in accessing information. The first theme was Challenges Navigating the Interactions Required to Access Information. This theme positions participants’ accounts of difficulty accessing socially mediated information within a reciprocal framework. The second theme was University Expectations Limit Information Access. This theme explains how university expectations, practices, and policies that were not designed with autistic students in mind can serve as a barrier to information access. Our participants’ experiences highlighted how access to information about the resources and opportunities that could support their success can impact not only their academic and interpersonal experiences, but also their sense of belonging to their university community.

We classify 134 countries into four development categories - high development, medium development, low development, and least development based on thirteen development and energy indicators. Using the quadratic plateau model, we estimate that an energy threshold of 94 GJ (±15) and an income threshold of $28,679 (±4179)  is necessary for meeting sustained levels of development defined by indicators for health, education, and infrastructure. We construct baseline scenarios for convergence to, or divergence from, these and other threshold values drawn from the literature, for each development category.  Emissions constraints are then imposed in the form of the remaining carbon budget corresponding to the temperature targets of the Paris Agreement to assess the degree of energy-emissions and energy-GDP decoupling that would be required to meet these targets without reliance on carbon-dioxide removal. Our results show that limiting warming to well below 2 deg. C and o 1.5 deg. C requires significantly higher effort across all regions, with the global effort differing only marginally across scenarios, irrespective of whether energy and climate equity are considered or not. However, the distribution of the global effort across development categories varies significantly, depending on whether energy and climate equity are considered or not. The mitigation burden for the highest development category is almost six times higher if climate equity is considered compared to scenarios in which climate equity is compromised.

To answer this question, here, we present a theory that combines cognitive neuroscience theories, namely stress-induced memory shift and competitive cognitive processes, with political science. Our Threat-based Neural Switch Theory posits that the processing of political information, similarly to other information processing, is shaped by the competitive interaction between goal-directed and habitual processes.

Methods: A detailed micro-costing study was undertaken in two tertiary hospitals in Brisbane, Australia, over a 12-month period from July 2021 to June 2022. Data were sourced from electronic medical record systems and reviewed by two study nurses to ensure accuracy. Data was collected on all relevant resource use components, including staff time, consumables, medications, and imaging.

Results: In total, 136 patients were included in the study (TACE: n=86; ablation: n=41; SIRT: n=9). The average total costs per admission were $7,079 for TACE, $6,763 for ablation, and $20,782 for SIRT (including both workup and delivery admissions).

In two independent samples, classification models were trained to classify individuals with high versus low depression symptom severity based on DCT responses.

Several meta-analyses have suggested significant associations between TSRs and, for example, academic achievement, a lack of disruptive behavior, school engagement, peer relationships, motivation, executive functions, and general well-being. However, these meta-analyses have differed substantially in TSR-outcome relationships, moderators, and quality, thus complicating the interpretation of these findings. In this preregistered systematic review of meta-analyses plus original second-order meta-analyses (SOMAs), we aimed to (a) synthesize the meta-analytic evidence on relationships between TSRs and student outcomes, (b) map influential moderators of these relationships, and (c) assess the methodological quality of the meta-analyses. We synthesized over 70 years of educational research in 24 meta-analyses encompassing a total of 116 effect sizes based on more than 2 million prekindergarten and K-12 students. We conducted several three-level SOMAs and found that TSRs had similar strong significant relationships with eight clusters of outcomes: academic achievement, academic emotions, appropriate student behavior, behavior problems, executive functions and self-control, motivation, school belonging and engagement, and student well-being. Age, gender, and informant (student-, peer-, or teacher-assessments) were the most frequently examined moderators in prior research, and our moderator analyses suggested student grade level and social minority status as moderators. We further found large differences in quality between the meta-analyses, and these differences were not associated with the TSR-outcome relationships. These results map the field of TSR research; present their relationships, moderators, and meta-analytic quality; and show how TSRs can contribute to improving outcomes in students via relationship building.

How to strike a balance among state authority, the digital power of platform enterprises, and fundamental human rights in the digital era is a novel challenge that demands collective consideration and resolution by human society. This paper introduces the concept of “user rights”. It establishes the imperative of constructing a user rights framework in light of the entirely new societal backdrop of the digital age, emphasizing the distinctive features that set user rights apart from existing consumer rights. Furthermore, by demonstrating the severe implications of user rights infringements for citizens’ political rights, as well as economic, social, cultural rights, especially the rights of vulnerable populations, the paper substantiates the legitimacy of establishing a user rights framework.

This has led to debate about whether shared or distinct mechanisms lead infants to look longer toward unexpected events (the violation-of-expectation response, or VOE) versus visually novel events (the perceptual novelty response, or PN). Here, we studied both looking behaviors using meta-analysis of condition-level data (from 34 papers, 78 conditions, and 1915 infants) and mega-analysis of infant-level data (from 25 papers, 60 conditions, and 1482 infants) from prior studies of infants’ understanding of agents and objects. First, we estimated VOE and PN in the same data and found that showing infants an unexpected event drove their looking behavior as reliably as showing infants a visually novel event. Second, we tested whether VOE and PN are supported by similar or distinct mechanisms. Under the hypothesis that both responses are driven by a common mechanism, the same factors should predict the size of both effects. However, these responses were moderated by different predictors. The PN effect was larger after infants were habituated instead of familiarized, and did not differ depending on infant age. The VOE effect, in contrast, was not moderated by habituation vs familiarization and was larger for younger infants.

These experiments employed the logic of conducting local experiments to obtain local evidence (local input - cause - local output) to contradict local realistic theories of nature in order to validate quantum mechanics as a fundamental nonlocal theory. Be that as it may, there was one loophole that was wittingly not tested by the Nobel laureates. The notable exception was Bell’s “super-deterministic” loophole which was tested in the nonlocal no-go Tempt Destiny Experiment (nonlocal input - cause - local output) from 2000-2012. The unambiguous empirical evidence obtained revealed two mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive predetermined nonlocal hidden variables that prohibit the experimenter from conducting all local experiments. Failure to account for nature’s two fundamental variables as causal functions inherently leads to false-positive and false-negative empirical evidence thus compromising the integrity of science. Furthermore, the mistaken assumption that said variables are trivial functions of sentient beings instead of fundamental mechanical functions of nature has inadvertently led to the creation of a new species otherwise known as “artificial intelligence”.",https://osf.io/he8ry/,2023-09-08T22:04:27.181634,"['USA', 'msm@prephysics.com']",OSF,

Despite this prediction, past studies have focused on the average effects of valued living on hedonic well-being and found positive associations. In order to examine the heterogeneity of the within-person links of values-based action with hedonic well-being and the possibility of negative associations, we used intensive experience sampling methods (participants (n) = 425; 71.76% female; age = M(SD) = 22.20 (6.85); sampling design: 3-4 prompts per day; total measurements (n) = 6,456). Time series and meta-analytic models revealed that increases in values-based living were positively related to hedonic well-being, but the heterogeneity in this effect was so great (I2 &gt; .80) that the average estimate did not apply to many people. Indeed, for some, valued action was associated with little joy and/or much sadness. A variety of aggregation methods based on idiographic models were examined. A sub-group was identified, which we labeled the ‘Stoics,’ for whom engagement in valued action in daily life was not contingent on sadness or joyfulness, unlike the Non-Stoics, as revealed in within-person networks. While overall levels of affect, valued action, and stressful events were the same in the two groups, network analysis further revealed that for Stoics, stressful situations were linked to valued action, but not hedonic well-being.

During empathic processing, we observed network hubs in the right middle frontal gyrus and angular
gyrus and a network encompassing the left superior medial frontal, orbitofrontal cortex, and inferior
frontal gyrus during ToM processing. Interestingly, the right middle frontal gyrus also showed the
highest voxel-wise degree centrality for the interaction of empathy and ToM.
Results from our degree centrality and seed-based functional connectivity analysis show dynamic
changes in the overall network configuration underlying the interaction of empathy and ToM. Network
hubs underlying empathic processing (right middle frontal gyrus) also mediate the interaction of social
affect and cognition, and this effect is driven by the emotional modulation of ToM processing
(processing emotional and ToM content simultaneously). These hub areas are situated in highly
interconnected networks and have been implicated in domain-specific and domain-general processing,
such as attentional control. Bottom-up attentional switching might be an important mechanism driving
cross-network interaction, in turn enabling behavioral adaptation to changing environmental demands
in naturalistic social cognition.",https://psyarxiv.com/c6gsz/,2023-09-08T18:29:52.341578,['lara.maliske@tu-dresden.de'],OSF,

Across 183 UK-based participants (Mage = 32.71 years, SD = 10.89), and after controlling for demographic factors and attitudes pertaining to IPV and individuals with disabilities, more punitive judgements (e.g., less victim blame) were reported in vignettes whereby the perpetrator was [1] male, and [2] was not disabled. There were no interaction effects. With results aligning with our hypotheses, we must consider whether these findings reflect the result of typical societal depictions of perpetrators of IPV as being able-bodied men; with depictions that fall out of this scope providing potential mitigations to the severity of IPV. Further, results have potential practical implications for recognising and reporting IPV, and so we call for further international research to be carried out on the role of disability in IPV and the qualitative experiences of both victims and perpetrators thereof.",https://psyarxiv.com/8fd2p/,2023-09-08T16:09:05.037349,"['deanfido.psych@gmail.com', 'UK', 'GB']",OSF,

Methods. We report the development and standardization of a mobile App, LanguageScreen (OxEd and Assessment, 2022), that can be used by education professionals to assess children’s language ability.
Methods. The standardization includes data from approximately 350,000 children aged 3:06 to 8:11 years who have been screened using LanguageScreen. for receptive and expressive language skills using LanguageScreen.   Rasch scaling was used to select items of appropriate difficulty on a single unidimensional scale.
Results. The test is shown to have excellent psychometric properties including high reliability, good fit to the Rasch model and minimal differential item functioning across key student groups.   Girls outperformed boys and children with English as an additional language scored less well than monolingual English speakers. 
Conclusions. LanguageScreen provides a highly reliable and, child-friendly means of identifying and monitoring the progress of children with language difficulties andthat is easy to use.

Empirical knowledge of psychopathy is often misrepresented in the media and miscommunicated to the general public. This can have practical implications in legal settings. This research investigated how the labels used when discussing individuals characterised by psychopathic traits impacts lay judgements and attributions of them. 

Methods
Participants (n = 477) read a randomised vignette that differed by the sex of the depicted character and the label used to describe them; namely ‘no label’, ‘having a clinical diagnosis’, and ‘displaying psychopathic personality traits’. Measures of mental health stigma and baseline beliefs about psychopathy were used as moderator variables.

Results
Results indicated that participants judged male (relative to female) characters, and those labelled as having either a psychopathy diagnosis or psychopathic personality traits (relative to no label conditions) more harshly. No interaction was found between these main effects, and neither mental health stigma nor beliefs about psychopathy moderated these differences. 

Conclusion

Because of the multifaceted nature of social cognition, deficits might be only observed when assessing specific facets of social cognition and under sufficiently demanding conditions. This study examined self-other distinction performance, a key facet lying at the core of the attachment-based model of mentalizing (Fonagy &amp; Luyten, 2009). Twenty-one forensic inpatients with ASPD and 19 participants from the community completed a visual perspective-taking paradigm allowing to tease apart self-other priority (i.e., how self-focused one is) from self-other distinction performance (i.e., how much one confuses his with others’ mental states). The ASPD group made significantly more errors at handling conflicting self-other viewpoints by enforcing self-other distinction (19%) than the control group (4%), but the ASPD group was not significantly more self-focused. In contrast, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index self-report scale did not differentiate the two groups. However, a novel measure of self-other distinction based on Empathic concern (i.e., the tendency to experience feelings of concern and compassion for others) and Personal distress subscales (i.e., the tendency to experience personal distress in response to the distress of others) did differentiate the two groups, albeit to a significantly lower extent than the objective measure of self-other distinction. Altogether, these findings are in line with the theory that there is a self-other distinction deficit in ASPD and advocate for psychometric approaches embracing the multifaceted nature of social cognition and the need for objective measures with sufficient sensitivity.",https://osf.io/s485w/,2023-09-08T14:26:21.491144,[],OSF,

But to act effectively we need to accurately sense what we can and cannot control. Classic theories across cognitive science suppose that this ‘sense of agency’ is constructed from the sensorimotor signals we experience as we interact with our surroundings. But these sensorimotor signals are inherently ambiguous, and can provide us with a distorted picture of what we can and cannot influence.  Here we investigate one way that agents like us might overcome the inherent ambiguity of these signals: by combining noisy sensorimotor evidence with prior beliefs about control acquired through explicit communication with others. Using novel tools to measure and model control decisions, we find that explicit beliefs about the controllability of the environment alter both the sensitivity and bias of agentic choices; meaning that we are both better at detecting and more biased to feel control when we are told to expect it. These seemingly paradoxical effects on agentic choices can be captured by a computational model where expecting to be in control exaggerates the sensitivity or ‘gain’ of the mechanisms we use to detect our influence over our surroundings – making us increasingly sensitised to both true and illusory signs of agency. In combination, these results reveal a cognitive and computational mechanism that allows public communication about what we can and cannot influence to reshape our private sense of control.",https://psyarxiv.com/4jxcv/,2023-09-08T13:53:01.996812,"['UK', 'd.yon@bbk.ac.uk']",OSF,

We investigate whether safeguards implemented in these chatbots contribute to the censorship of information that is viewed as harmful by the regime, in particular information about Vladimir Putin and the Russian war against Ukraine, and whether these safeguards enable the generation of false claims, in particular in relation to the regime's internal and external opponents. To detect whether LLM safeguards reiterate political bias, the article compares the outputs of prompts focusing on Putin's regime and the ones dealing with the Russian opposition and the US and Ukrainian politicians. It also examines whether the degree of bias varies depending on the language of the prompt and compares outputs concerning political personalities and issues across three languages: Russian, Ukrainian, and English. The results reveal significant disparities in how individual chatbots withhold politics-related information or produce false claims in relation to it. Notably, Bard consistently refused to respond to queries about Vladimir Putin in Russian, even when the relevant information was accessible via Google Search, and generally followed the censorship guidelines that, according to Yandex-related data leaks, were issued by the Russian authorities. In terms of false claims, we find substantial variation across languages with Ukrainian and Russian prompts generating false information more often and Bard being more prone to produce false claims in relation to Russian regime opponents (e.g., Navalny or Zelenskyy) than other chatbots.

While traditional forms of such assessments require candidates to self-report their characteristics via questionnaire measures, recent research suggests that computers can predict people’s psychological traits from the digital footprints they leave online (e.g., their Facebook profiles, Twitter posts or credit card spending). Although such models become increasingly available via third-party providers, the use of external data in the hiring process poses considerable ethical and legal challenges. In this paper, we examine the predictability of personality traits from models that are trained exclusively on data generated during the recruiting process. Specifically, we leverage information from CVs and free-text answers collected as part of a real-world, high-stakes recruiting process in combination with natural language processing to predict applicants’ Big Five personality traits (N = 8,313 applicants). We show that the models provide consistent moderate predictive accuracy when comparing the machine learning-based predictions with the self-reported personality traits (average r = .25), outperforming recruiter judgments reported in prior literature. Although the models only capture a comparatively small part of the variance in self-reports, our findings suggest that they might still be relevant in practice by showing that automated predictions of personality are just as good (and sometimes better) at predicting key external criteria for job matching (i.e., vocational interests) as self-reported assessments.",https://psyarxiv.com/bc4v9/,2023-09-08T09:36:59.521627,"['RU', 'USA']",OSF,

Although the classic view in the field points to different neural substrates underlying beat-based vs. duration-based mechanisms, recent neuroimaging evidence provided support to a unified model wherein these two systems overlap. In line with this, previous research demonstrated that internalized beat cues benefit motor reproduction of longer intervals (&gt; 5.5 s) by reducing underestimation, but little is known about this effect on pure perceptual tasks. The present study was designed to investigate whether and how interval estimation is modulated by available beat cues. To that end, we asked 155 participants to estimate auditory intervals ranging from 500 ms to 10 s, while manipulating the presence of cues before the interval, as well as the reinforcement of these cues by beat-related interference within the interval (vs. beat-unrelated and no interference). Beat cues aided time estimation depending on interval duration: for intervals longer than 5 s, estimation was better in the cue than in the no-cue condition. Specifically, the levels of underestimation decreased in the presence of cues, indicating that beat cues had a facilitating effect on time perception very similar to the one observed previously for time production. Interference had no effects, suggesting that this manipulation was not effective. Our findings are consistent with the idea of cooperation between beat- and duration-based systems and suggest that this cooperation is quite similar across production and perception.",https://psyarxiv.com/ghru5/,2023-09-08T08:44:29.509212,['up@edu.fpce.up.pt'],OSF,

Analysis of 246,000 tweets sent by 32,453 unique accounts reveals a dominant presence of the Yes campaign, with five times greater tweet volume than the No campaign. The hyperpolarised (Bruns, 2023) discourse on Twitter is marked by misinformation and conspiracy theories stemming from Vote No campaigners and further amplified by attempts to criticise and fact-check it from the Vote Yes camp. Politicians and media outlets play a pivotal role in shaping this discourse, with platforms like Twitter both reinforcing and evolving the ‘racial division’ and ‘hidden agenda’ narratives these elite actors promote. Specifically, Sky News Australia emerges as a significant influencer, amplified by both sides. The No campaign displays a significantly greater proportion of suspicious accounts. An influx of newly created pseudonymous accounts with fabricated or no profile information promote Vote No arguments, engage in trolling and sharing discriminatory content, and spread conspiratorial narratives. We find little evidence of social bots participating in the online discussions. Overall, our findings reveal a media ecosystem fraught with confusion, conspiratorial sensemaking, and strategic media manipulation.

Previous research has shown that music evokes strong emotional responses that persist across the lifespan and over time. However, the mechanisms underlying the emotional effects of music, particularly in older adults, are largely unknown. One purported mechanism by which music evokes emotions is episodic memory – that is, music evokes memories that then lead to emotional responses. In the present study, we investigated whether memory-evoking music induces stronger and longer-lasting emotional responses than music that is not associated with memories, and whether these emotional responses differ between younger and older adults. 
Methods. Older (N=30) and younger adults (N=30) listened to two blocks of self-selected music (one block of memory-evoking music and one block of familiar but non-memory-evoking music). Participants reported their emotions prior to listening and at three timepoints post-listening. 
Results. Overall, older adults reported higher levels of positive affect than younger adults. For both groups, positive affect increased after listening to both memory-evoking and non-memory-evoking music. However, negative affect only increased after listening to memory-evoking music. 
Conclusions. These results suggest that both memory-evoking and non-memory-evoking music generate strong emotions across the lifespan, but music that conjures personal memories is more likely to elicit mixed positive and negative emotions. Our results have important clinical implications when designing music-based interventions for mood and affect, particularly in older adult populations.",https://psyarxiv.com/tk4gh/,2023-09-07T21:03:44.596427,"['University of Kentucky', 'amybelfi@mst.edu', 'Missouri University of Science and Technology', 'Missouri University of Science and Technology ']",OSF,

However, there are substantial gaps in the literature on the efficacy and impact of these trainings on students that hamper our ability to provide evidence-based services. This review first identifies the basic structure of active shooter training format and content. Next, we review the available outcome research on safety, preparedness, stress, and long-term mental and emotional health based on training format and content. Finally, we identify some specific characteristics (participants of color, children of different ages, adverse experience and trauma history) that may guide thinking of individual differences in these trainings’ impact.

Method: Individual psychotherapy patients (N = 700) completed the RRI-C along with other measures. Psychometric scale shortening involved exploratory factor analysis, item response theory analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis. Reliability and convergent and discriminant validity of the scale and subscales were also assessed.
Results: The 8-item Real Relationship Inventory–Client Short Form (RRI-C-SF) preserves the two-factor structure: Genuineness (k=4, α=.87) and Realism (k=4, α=.86), which were correlated at r=.75. CFA provided the following fit indices: X2/df=4.88, CFI=.98, TLI=.97, RMSEA=.07, and SRMR=.03. The RRI-C-SF demonstrated high reliability (α=.91); high correlation with the full-length scale (r=.96); and excellent convergent and discriminant validity with measures of other elements of the therapeutic relationship, personality characteristics, current mental health state, and demographic-clinical variables. Clinical change benchmarks were calculated to serve as valuable tools for both research and clinical practice.

We analyze the temporal effects in explaining the diminishing self-rated health (SRH), how social, economic, and demographic factors contribute to the health reversal, and how SRH inequalities have changed over time.

Method: We analyzed 29 waves of cross-section data from the General Social Survey (1972-2018, N = 46,133). This study employed Bayesian Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort models and frequentist Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort Cross-Classified Random Effect models (HAPC-CCRM) to estimate age, period, and cohort effects. We discuss how Bayesian Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort can resolve the age-period-cohort identification problem.

Results: Both frequentist and Bayesian models show an-inverted U-shaped period effect on SRH. Results affirm a health decline at the turn of the 21st century. This downward trend is present regardless of gender, race, income, education, and employment status. While income, education, and employment disparities in SRH have widened in the last two decades, we find that racial and gender gaps in SRH have shrunk in the same period due to the diminishing SRH advantage of white males. Nevertheless, racial inequalities in SRH persist, and the SRH decline applies to all racial, gender, and socio-economically disadvantaged groups.

Conclusion: Consistent with a negative epidemiological trend in mortality and morbidity in the US, SRH has worsened in the 21st century after considering age and cohort effects. Income and education remain significant determinants of self-rated health. We discuss how the ongoing opioid crisis and social dislocation of the white working class since the late 1990s could be the culprits of declining SRH.

Accounting for differences in age, socioeconomic status, and residence type explains the higher risk of mortality for both widowed women and men aged 60 and above, but not for those aged 25 to 59.

In this age group, we also document a survival disadvantage for widows exposed to conservative and less egalitarian gender norms, and for less educated widowers.

Furthermore, conceptual confusion is rife with use and prevalence of QRPs often being confused as the same quantity. We present the hitherto most comprehensive study examining QRPs across countries and main scholarly fields. We survey perception, use, prevalence and predictors of QRP among 3,402 researchers in Denmark and 1,307 in the UK, USA, Croatia and Austria. 
Results reveal remarkably similar response patterns among Danish and international respondents (τ = 0.85). Self-reported use indicates whether respondents have used a QRP in recent publications. Overall, 9 out of 10 admitted having used at least one QRP. Median use is three out of nine QRP-items. Response patterns were also similar across fields, except for arts and humanities where rates were somewhat lower. Self-reported prevalence reflects the frequency of use. On average, prevalence rates were roughly three times lower compared to self-reported use. Findings indicated that self-report patterns were influenced by perceived social acceptability of QRPs. Results suggest that within a restricted time period most researchers use different types QRPs. The prevalence estimates, however, do not suggest outright systematic use of specific QRPs. 
Perceived pressure was the strongest systemic predictor for prevalence. Conversely, more attention locally to research cultures, as well as academic age were negatively related to prevalence. Finally, the personality traits conscientiousness and agreeableness were also inversely associated with self-reported prevalence. Findings suggest that explanations of self-reported prevalence of QRPs is a complicated mixture of experience, systemic and individual factors, as well as motivated reasoning.",https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/r6j3z/,2023-09-13T18:52:18.662234,"['jws@ps.au.dk', 'UK']",OSF,

Few studies, however, examine the cultural mechanism central to the thesis, where an occupation's prestige changes in response to the dynamics of its cultural association with women. This paper proposes a new semantic approach to trace the devaluation process in American culture, where occupation titles appear in scholarly and public discourses with varied semantic proximity to gender- and prestige-signaling phrases over time. Decade-specific occupation embedding (1900-2019) from 127 billion words of American English across genres and a novel decomposition of fixed-effects estimation show a latent cultural bias against women's work, such that an occupation's prestige declines when it becomes increasingly stereotyped as a female job. Penalties appear throughout the period, with the largest effects found in lower-income occupations; most high-income occupations, despite experiencing large increases in female share in recent years, are persistently stereotyped as male professions without a significant prestige loss.

In response to this novel threat, authoritarian regimes introduced censorship firewalls which seem to fail at their task: millions bypass these restrictions everyday. We contend that the regime deliberately aims for a specific segment of the population to self-select into bypassing the firewall: regime opponents. By bypassing the firewall, opponents are occasionally convinced to comply after seeing positive and credible reporting about the regime by banned foreign outlets. The firewall ensures that regime supporters exclusively consume content from domestic outlets and so their compliance is secured via regime propaganda. We label this strategy one of segment-and-rule and show how it maximizes compliance.

In addition, our formulation allows the choice between portfoliosparsity and turnover sparsity constraints, which also reduces transactioncosts by limiting the number of assets that are updated at each rebalancing.Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm for solving this problem basedon a primal-dual splitting method. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness ofthe proposed method through experiments on the S\&P500 and NASDAQ100 indexdatasets.",,,"['yamagata.e.ab@m.titech.ac.jp', 'LU', 'ND']",arXiv,2023-09-21

This paper proposes a novel approach for intelligentbuilding operations monitoring using rule-based complex event processing andquery-based approaches for dynamically monitoring the different operations.Siddhi is a complex event processing engine designed for handling multiplesources of event data in real time and processing it according to predefinedrules using a decision tree. Since streaming data is dynamic in nature, to keeptrack of different operations, we have converted the IoT data into an RDFdataset. The RDF dataset is ingested to Apache Kafka for streaming purposes andfor stored data we have used the GraphDB tool that extracts information withthe help of SPARQL query. Consequently, the proposed approach is also evaluatedby deploying the large number of events through the Siddhi CEP engine and howefficiently they are processed in terms of time. Apart from that, a riskestimation scenario is also designed to generate alerts for end users in caseany of the smart building operations need immediate attention.

However, when the graph structure is distributed acrossseveral parties, its analysis is particularly challenging. In particular, dueto the sensitivity of the data each party might want to keep their partialknowledge of the graph private, while still willing to collaborate with theother parties for tasks of mutual benefit, such as data curation or the removalof poisoned data. To address this challenge, we propose Crypto'Graph, anefficient protocol for privacy-preserving link prediction on distributedgraphs. More precisely, it allows parties partially sharing a graph withdistributed links to infer the likelihood of formation of new links in thefuture. Through the use of cryptographic primitives, Crypto'Graph is able tocompute the likelihood of these new links on the joint network withoutrevealing the structure of the private individual graph of each party, eventhough they know the number of nodes they have, since they share the same graphbut not the same links. Crypto'Graph improves on previous works by enabling thecomputation of a certain number of similarity metrics without any additionalcost. The use of Crypto'Graph is illustrated for defense against graphpoisoning attacks, in which it is possible to identify potential adversariallinks without compromising the privacy of the graphs of individual parties.

Wedemonstrate the performance of this approach on data from challenging terrains;mean intersection over union (mIoU) scores range between 67.4% and 82.2%depending on the amount of environmental structure. This outperforms thegeometric baseline used in all experiments. The neural network runs faster than10Hz and is integrated into a robot's autonomy stack to allow safe navigationaround obstacles that intersect the planned path. In addition, a novel methodfor the rapid automated acquisition of per-point ground-truth labels isdescribed. Covering changed parts of the scene with retroreflective materialsand applying a threshold filter to the intensity channel of the LiDAR allowsfor quantitative evaluation of the change detector.",,,"['ODU', 'tim.barfoot@utoronto.ca', 'UC']",arXiv,2023-09-21

The simplistic approach of pairwiseattribute comparison fails to harness the wealth of information encapsulatedwithin entities.To address these challenges, we introduce a novel entitymatching model, dubbed Entity Matching Model for Capturing Complex AttributeRelationships(EMM-CCAR),built upon pre-trained models. Specifically, this modeltransforms the matching task into a sequence matching problem to mitigate theimpact of varying data formats. Moreover, by introducing attention mechanisms,it identifies complex relationships between attributes, emphasizing the degreeof matching among multiple attributes rather than one-to-one correspondences.Through the integration of the EMM-CCAR model, we adeptly surmount thechallenges posed by data heterogeneity and intricate attributeinterdependencies. In comparison with the prevalent DER-SSM and Dittoapproaches, our model achieves improvements of approximately 4% and 1% in F1scores, respectively.

However, edge devices' limited storage and computingresources make it challenging to perform complex predictive modeling at theedge. Compute-in-memory (CiM) has emerged as a principal paradigm to minimizeenergy for deep learning-based inference at the edge. Nevertheless, integratingstorage and processing complicates memory cells and/or memory peripherals,essentially trading off area efficiency for energy efficiency. This paperproposes a novel solution to improve area efficiency in deep learning inferencetasks. The proposed method employs two key strategies. Firstly, a Frequencydomain learning approach uses binarized Walsh-Hadamard Transforms, reducing thenecessary parameters for DNN (by 87% in MobileNetV2) and enablingcompute-in-SRAM, which better utilizes parallelism during inference. Secondly,a memory-immersed collaborative digitization method is described among CiMarrays to reduce the area overheads of conventional ADCs. This facilitates moreCiM arrays in limited footprint designs, leading to better parallelism andreduced external memory accesses. Different networking configurations areexplored, where Flash, SA, and their hybrid digitization steps can beimplemented using the memory-immersed scheme. The results are demonstratedusing a 65 nm CMOS test chip, exhibiting significant area and energy savingscompared to a 40 nm-node 5-bit SAR ADC and 5-bit Flash ADC.

Conventional methods, refined over decades, tackle this challengein two steps: genome indexing followed by efficient search to locate likelypositions for given reads. Building on the success of Large Language Models(LLM) in encoding text into embeddings, where the distance metric capturessemantic similarity, recent efforts have explored whether the same Transformerarchitecture can produce numerical representations for DNA sequences. Suchmodels have shown early promise in tasks involving classification of short DNAsequences, such as the detection of coding vs non-coding regions, as well asthe identification of enhancer and promoter sequences. Performance at sequenceclassification tasks does not, however, translate to sequence alignment, whereit is necessary to conduct a genome-wide search to successfully align everyread. We address this open problem by framing it as an Embed-Search-Align task.In this framework, a novel encoder model DNA-ESA generates representations ofreads and fragments of the reference, which are projected into a shared vectorspace where the read-fragment distance is used as surrogate for alignment. Inparticular, DNA-ESA introduces: (1) Contrastive loss for self-supervisedtraining of DNA sequence representations, facilitating rich sequence-levelembeddings, and (2) a DNA vector store to enable search across fragments on aglobal scale.

A keyquestion in PFL is to decide which parameters of a client should be localizedor shared with others. In current mainstream approaches, all layers that aresensitive to non-IID data (such as classifier layers) are generallypersonalized. The reasoning behind this approach is understandable, aslocalizing parameters that are easily influenced by non-IID data can preventthe potential negative effect of collaboration. However, we believe that thisapproach is too conservative for collaboration. For example, for a certainclient, even if its parameters are easily influenced by non-IID data, it canstill benefit by sharing these parameters with clients having similar datadistribution. This observation emphasizes the importance of considering notonly the sensitivity to non-IID data but also the similarity of datadistribution when determining which parameters should be localized in PFL. Thispaper introduces a novel guideline for client collaboration in PFL. Unlikeexisting approaches that prohibit all collaboration of sensitive parameters,our guideline allows clients to share more parameters with others, leading toimproved model performance. Additionally, we propose a new PFL method namedFedCAC, which employs a quantitative metric to evaluate each parameter'ssensitivity to non-IID data and carefully selects collaborators based on thisevaluation.

Thishypothesis is based not only on the general observation that many real networkshave multilevel organization, which is reminiscent of the geometricself-similarity of classical fractals. Quantitative arguments supporting thishypothesis are: first, many non-fractal real complex networks that have awell-defined community structure reveal fractal properties when suitablydiluted; second, the scale-free community size distributions observed in manyreal networks directly relate to scale-invariant box mass distributions, whichhave recently been described as a fundamental feature of fractal complexnetworks. We test this hypothesis in a general model of evolving network withcommunity structure that exhibits dual scale invariance: at the level of nodedegrees and community sizes, respectively. We show that, at least in thismodel, the proposed hypothesis cannot be rejected.

Second, for estimating theaverage effect, it partitions the feature domain into user-defined, fixed-sizedbins, where different bin sizes may lead to inconsistent ALE estimations.

Thisis especially true for proof-of-stake blockchain protocols in which the nextminer or set of miners have to be chosen randomly and each party's likelihoodto be selected is in proportion to their stake in the cryptocurrency.Current random beacons used in proof-of-stake protocols, such as Ouroborosand Algorand, have two fundamental limitations: Either (i)~they rely onpseudorandomness, e.g.~assuming that the output of a hash function is uniform,which is a widely-used but unproven assumption, or (ii)~they generate theirrandomness using a distributed protocol in which several participants arerequired to submit random numbers which are then used in the generation of afinal random result. However, in this case, there is no guarantee that thenumbers provided by the parties are uniformly random and there is no incentivefor the parties to honestly generate uniform randomness. Most random beaconshave both limitations.In this thesis, we provide a protocol for distributed generation ofrandomness. Our protocol does not rely on pseudorandomness at all. Similar tosome of the previous approaches, it uses random inputs by differentparticipants to generate a final random result. However, the crucial differenceis that we provide a game-theoretic guarantee showing that it is in everyone'sbest interest to submit uniform random numbers. Hence, our approach is thefirst to incentivize honest behavior instead of just assuming it. Moreover, theapproach is trustless and generates unbiased random numbers.

In this paper, we propose a real-timecross-platform neural video codec, which is capable of efficiently decoding of720P video bitstream from other encoding platforms on a consumer-grade GPU.First, to solve the problem of inconsistency of codec caused by the uncertaintyof floating point calculations across platforms, we design a calibrationtransmitting system to guarantee the consistent quantization of entropyparameters between the encoding and decoding stages. The parameters that mayhave transboundary quantization between encoding and decoding are identified inthe encoding stage, and their coordinates will be delivered by auxiliarytransmitted bitstream. By doing so, these inconsistent parameters can beprocessed properly in the decoding stage. Furthermore, to reduce the bitrate ofthe auxiliary bitstream, we rectify the distribution of entropy parametersusing a piecewise Gaussian constraint. Second, to match the computationallimitations on the decoding side for real-time video codec, we design alightweight model. A series of efficiency techniques enable our model toachieve 25 FPS decoding speed on NVIDIA RTX 2080 GPU. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that our model can achieve real-time decoding of 720P videos whileencoding on another platform.

In this thesis, we consider interprocedural data-flowanalysis as formalized by the standard IFDS framework, which can express manywidely-used static analyses such as reaching definitions, live variables, andnull-pointer. We focus on the well-studied on-demand setting in which queriesarrive one-by-one in a stream and each query should be answered as fast aspossible. While the classical IFDS algorithm provides a polynomial-timesolution to this problem, it is not scalable in practice. Specifically, iteither requires a quadratic-time preprocessing phase or takes linear time perquery, both of which are untenable for modern huge codebases with hundreds ofthousands of lines. Previous works have already shown that parameterizing theproblem by the treewidth of the program's control-flow graph is promising andcan lead to significant gains in efficiency. Unfortunately, these results wereonly applicable to the limited special case of same-context queries.In this work, we obtain significant speedups for the general case ofon-demand IFDS with queries that are not necessarily same-context. This isachieved by exploiting a new graph sparsity parameter, namely the treedepth ofthe program's call graph. Our approach is the first to exploit the sparsity ofcontrol-flow graphs and call graphs at the same time and parameterize by bothtreewidth and treedepth. We obtain an algorithm with a linear preprocessingphase that can answer each query in constant time with respect to the inputsize.

Thecontract's execution is then performed on-chain and is subject to consensus,i.e. every node on the blockchain network has to run the function calls andkeep track of their side-effects. In most programmable blockchains, such asEthereum, the notion of gas is introduced to prevent DoS attacks by maliciousparties who might try to slow down the network by performing heavycomputations. A fixed cost to each atomic operation, and the initiator of afunction call pays the total gas cost as a transaction fee. This helps preventDoS attacks, but the resulting fees are extremely high. For example, in 2022,on Ethereum alone, there has been a total gas usage of 1.77 Million ETH ~ 4.3Billion USD. This thesis proposes ""lazy contracts"" as a solution to alleviatethese costs. Our solution moves most of the computation off-chain, ensuringthat each function call incurs only a tiny amount of gas usage, whilepreserving enough data on-chain to guarantee an implicit consensus about thestate of the contract variables and ownership of funds. A complete on-chainexecution of the functions will only be triggered in case two parties to thecontract are in disagreement about the current state, which in turn can onlyhappen if at least one party is dishonest. In such cases, our protocol canidentify the dishonest party and penalize them by having them pay for theentire gas usage. Hence, no rational party has an incentive to act dishonestly.Finally, we perform extensive experiments over 160,735 real-world Soliditycontracts that were involved in 9,055,492 transactions in January 2022--January2023 on Ethereum and show that our approach reduces the overall gas usage by55.4%, which amounts to an astounding saving of 109.9 Million USD in gas fees.",,,[],arXiv,2023-09-21

Despite being an active field of research, Zhang's method remainswidely used for camera calibration due to its implementation in populartoolboxes. However, this method initially assumes a pinhole model withoversimplified distortion models. In this work, we propose a novel approachthat involves a pre-processing step to remove distortions from images by meansof Gaussian processes. Our method does not need to assume any distortion modeland can be applied to severely warped images, even in the case of multipledistortion sources, e.g., a fisheye image of a curved mirror reflection. TheGaussian processes capture all distortions and camera imperfections, resultingin virtual images as though taken by an ideal pinhole camera with squarepixels. Furthermore, this ideal GP-camera only needs one image of a square gridcalibration pattern. This model allows for a serious upgrade of many algorithmsand applications that are designed in a pure projective geometry setting butwith a performance that is very sensitive to nonlinear lens distortions. Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our method by simplifying Zhang's calibrationmethod, reducing the number of parameters and getting rid of the distortionparameters and iterative optimization.

It is known thatsymmetric deadlock-free mutual exclusion is solvable for any finite number ofprocesses using anonymous registers [1]. The main question left open in [14,15]is the existence of starvation-free mutual exclusion algorithms for two or moreprocesses. We resolve this open question for memoryless algorithms, in which aprocess that tries to enter its critical section does not use any informationabout its previous attempts. Almost all known mutual exclusion algorithms arememoryless. We show that (1) there is a symmetric memoryless starvation-freemutual exclusion algorithm for two processes using $m \geq 7$ anonymousregisters if and only if $m$ is odd; and (2) there is no symmetric memorylessstarvation-free mutual exclusion algorithm for $n\geq 3$ processes using (anynumber of) anonymous registers. Our impossibility result is the only example ofa system with fault-free processes, where global progress (i.e.,deadlock-freedom) can be ensured, while individual progress to each process(i.e., starvation-freedom) cannot.

Firstly, we can view a digraphas a residuated mapping on the power set lattice; as such, we define a graph ona complete lattice as a residuated mapping on that lattice. We extend andgeneralise some results on digraphs to our setting. Secondly, we introduce ageneralised notion of dependency whereby any mapping $\phi$ can depend on anyother mapping $\alpha$. In fact, we are able to give four kinds of dependencyin this case. We can then vastly expand Robert's theorem to self-mappings ongeneral complete lattices; we similarly generalise the feedback bound. We thenobtain stronger results in the case where the lattice is a complete Booleanalgebra. We finally show how our results can be applied to prove theconvergence of automata networks.",,,"['m.r.gadouleau@durham.ac.uk', 'UK']",arXiv,2023-09-21

In this paper, we introduce a generalization of this powerfulalgorithmic primitive that is phrased in terms of $k$-secluded vertex sets:sets with an open neighborhood of size at most $k$.In this terminology, the bound on important separators says that there are atmost $4^k$ maximal $k$-secluded connected vertex sets $C$ containing $S$ butdisjoint from $T$. We generalize this statement significantly: even when wedemand that $G[C]$ avoids a finite set $\mathcal{F}$ of forbidden inducedsubgraphs, the number of such maximal subgraphs is $2^{O(k)}$ and they can beenumerated efficiently. This allows us to make significant improvements for twoproblems from the literature.Our first application concerns the 'Connected $k$-Secluded $\mathcal{F}$-freesubgraph' problem, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a finite set of forbidden inducedsubgraphs. Given a graph in which each vertex has a positive integer weight,the problem asks to find a maximum-weight connected $k$-secluded vertex set $C\subseteq V(G)$ such that $G[C]$ does not contain an induced subgraphisomorphic to any $F \in \mathcal{F}$. The parameterization by $k$ is known tobe solvable in triple-exponential time via the technique of recursiveunderstanding, which we improve to single-exponential.Our second application concerns the deletion problem to scattered graphclasses. Here, the task is to find a vertex set of size at most $k$ whoseremoval yields a graph whose each connected component belongs to one of theprescribed graph classes $\Pi_1, \ldots, \Pi_d$. We obtain a single-exponentialalgorithm whenever each class $\Pi_i$ is characterized by a finite number offorbidden induced subgraphs.

To capture system non-idealities such as optical aberrations, amainstream approach is to conduct an offline calibration scan to measure thesystem response for a point source at each spatial location on the imaginggrid. However, it is challenging to run calibration scans when using structuredSLMs as they cannot encode individual grid locations. In this study, we proposea novel compressive FPA system based on online deep-learning calibration ofmultiplexed LR measurements (CalibFPA). We introduce a piezo-stage thatlocomotes a pre-printed fixed coded aperture. A deep neural network is thenleveraged to correct for the influences of system non-idealities in multiplexedmeasurements without the need for offline calibration scans. Finally, a deepplug-and-play algorithm is used to reconstruct images from correctedmeasurements. On simulated and experimental datasets, we demonstrate thatCalibFPA outperforms state-of-the-art compressive FPA methods. We also reportanalyses to validate the design elements in CalibFPA and assess computationalcomplexity.",,,"['ODU', 'alpergungor@windowslive.com', 'Cal', 'UC']",arXiv,2023-09-21

Recall that a distance labeling is a distributed representation ofdistances in a metric space $(X,d)$, where each point $x\in X$ is assigned asuccinct label, such that the distance between any two points $x,y \in X$ canbe approximated given only their labels. A highly structured special case is anembedding into $\ell_\infty$, where each point $x\in X$ is assigned a vector$f(x)$ such that $\|f(x)-f(y)\|_\infty$ is approximately $d(x,y)$. Theperformance of a distance labeling or an $\ell_\infty$-embedding is measuredvia its distortion and its label-size/dimension.We also study the analogous question for the prioritized versions of thesetwo measures. Here, a priority order $\pi=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ of the point set $X$is given, and higher-priority points should have shorter labels. Formally, adistance labeling has prioritized label-size $\alpha(\cdot)$ if every $x_j$ haslabel size at most $\alpha(j)$. Similarly, an embedding $f: X \to \ell_\infty$has prioritized dimension $\alpha(\cdot)$ if $f(x_j)$ is non-zero only in thefirst $\alpha(j)$ coordinates. In addition, we compare these prioritizedmeasures to their classical (worst-case) versions.We answer these questions in several scenarios, uncovering a surprisinglydiverse range of behaviors. First, in some cases labelings and embeddings havevery similar worst-case performance, but in other cases there is a hugedisparity. However in the prioritized setting, we most often find a strictseparation between the performance of labelings and embeddings. And finally,when comparing the classical and prioritized settings, we find that theworst-case bound for label size often ""translates"" to a prioritized one, butalso find a surprising exception to this rule.",,,"['SC', 'leead@ariel.ac.il', 'arnold.filtser@biu.ac.il', 'robert.krauthgamer@weizmann.ac.il']",arXiv,2023-09-21

Then, every customer selects, simultaneously and independently, tomatch with a supplier or to remain unmatched. Each supplier observes the subsetof customers that selected them, and choose either to match a customer or toleave the system. Therefore, a match takes place if both a customer and asupplier sequentially select each other. Each agent's behavior is probabilisticand determined by a discrete choice model. Our goal is to choose an assortmentfamily that maximizes the expected revenue of the matching. Given the hardnessof the problem, we show a $1-1/e$-approximation factor for the heterogeneoussetting where customers follow general choice models and suppliers follow ageneral choice model whose demand function is monotone and submodular. Ourapproach is flexible enough to allow for different assortment constraints andfor a revenue objective function. Furthermore, we design an algorithm thatbeats the $1-1/e$ barrier and, in fact, is asymptotically optimal whensuppliers follow the classic multinomial-logit choice model and aresufficiently selective. We finally provide other results and further insights.Notably, in the unconstrained setting where customers and suppliers followmultinomial-logit models, we design a simple and efficient approximationalgorithm that appropriately randomizes over a family of nested-assortments.Also, we analyze various aspects of the matching market model that lead toseveral operational insights, such as the fact that matching platforms canbenefit from allowing the more selective agents to initiate the matchmakingprocess.",,,"['Cornell University', 'lodi@cornell.edu', 'GT', 'alfredo.torrico@cornell.edu']",arXiv,2023-09-21

We further propose a modeling paradigm of hierarchicalmodular networks, which consist of a planner and reactors that convert NLintents to predictions of executable programs and probe the environment forinformation necessary to complete the program execution. We instantiate thisframework on the IQA and ALFRED datasets for NL instruction following. Ourmodel outperforms reactive baselines by a large margin on both datasets. Wealso demonstrate that our framework is more data-efficient, and that it allowsfor fast iterative development.",,,['Carnegie Mellon University'],arXiv,2023-09-21

Although these methods show that incorporating edgeinformation is beneficial, how edge information helps remains unclear, makingit difficult for users to analyze its usefulness. To shed light on this issue,in this study, we propose a new algorithm called Diffusion Unit (DU) thathandles edge information in a principled and interpretable manner whileproviding decent improvement. First, we theoretically show that DU learns toperform task-beneficial edge enhancement and suppression. Second, weexperimentally observe and verify the edge enhancement and suppressionbehavior. Third, we empirically demonstrate that this behavior contributes toperformance improvement. Extensive experiments and analyses performed onchallenging benchmarks verify the effectiveness of DU. Specifically, our methodachieves state-of-the-art performance in object part segmentation usingShapeNet part and scene segmentation using S3DIS.

Recentadvances from deep learning have shown promising prospects in fossil imageidentification. However, the quantity and quality of labeled fossil images areoften limited due to fossil preservation, conditioned sampling, and expensiveand inconsistent label annotation by domain experts, which pose greatchallenges to training deep learning based image classification models. Toaddress these challenges, we follow the idea of the wisdom of crowds andpropose a multiview ensemble framework, which collects Original (O), Gray (G),and Skeleton (S) views of each fossil image reflecting its differentcharacteristics to train multiple base models, and then makes the finaldecision via soft voting. Experiments on the largest fusulinid dataset with2400 images show that the proposed OGS consistently outperforms baselines(using a single model for each view), and obtains superior or comparableperformance compared to OOO (using three base models for three the sameOriginal views). While considering the identification consistency estimationwith respect to human experts, OGS receives the highest agreement with theoriginal labels of dataset and with the re-identifications of two humanexperts. We conclude that the proposed framework can present state-of-the-artperformance in the fusulinid fossil identification case study.

As a result, RA-SLAM inference is sensitive to initialestimates yet lacks reliable initialization techniques. Our approach,certifiably correct RA-SLAM (CORA), leverages a novel quadratically constrainedquadratic programming (QCQP) formulation of RA-SLAM to relax the RA-SLAMproblem to a semidefinite program (SDP). CORA solves the SDP efficiently usingthe Riemannian Staircase methodology; the SDP solution provides both (i) alower bound on the RA-SLAM problem's optimal value, and (ii) an approximatesolution of the RA-SLAM problem, which can be subsequently refined using localoptimization.

This operation requires the removal of the skull, which isapproximately 300 um thick, to cut it into a circular shape 8 mm in diameter,but the shape of the mouse skull varies depending on the strain of mouse, sexand week of age. The thickness of the skull is not uniform, with some areasbeing thin and others thicker. It is also difficult to ensure that the skullsof the mice are kept in the same position for each operation.

The trajectoryplanning adjusts the z-position of the drill according to the task completionlevel at each discrete point, and forms the 3D drilling path via constrainedcubic spline interpolation while avoiding overshoot. The task completion levelrecognition uses a DSSD-inspired deep learning model to estimate the taskcompletion level of each discrete point.

The conversionof coordinate systems can be typically dubbed as \emph{gauge transformation},which is usually a pre-defined mapping function, e.g., orthogonal projection orspatial hash function.

Still, there are many problems in differential privacy for which wedon't know suitable lower bounds, and even for problems that we do, the lowerbounds are not smooth, and usually become vacuous when the error is larger thansome threshold.In this work, we present a simple method to generate hard instances byapplying a padding-and-permuting transformation to a fingerprinting code. Weillustrate the applicability of this method by providing new lower bounds invarious settings:1. A tight lower bound for DP averaging in the low-accuracy regime, which inparticular implies a new lower bound for the private 1-cluster problemintroduced by Nissim, Stemmer, and Vadhan (PODS 2016).2.

This module adopts anon-autoregressive network to obtain context prior and improve the predictionefficiency, and it learns a speech-animation mapping prior with bettergeneralization to novel speech from a multi-identity video dataset.

However, in the medical imaging domain,annotated datasets for specific tasks are often small due to the highcomplexity of annotations, limited access, or the rarity of diseases. Toaddress this challenge, deep learning models can be pre-trained on large imagedatasets without annotations using methods from the field of self-supervisedlearning. After pre-training, small annotated datasets are sufficient tofine-tune the models for a specific task. The most popular self-supervisedpre-training approaches in medical imaging are based on contrastive learning.However, recent studies in natural image processing indicate a strong potentialfor masked autoencoder approaches. Our work compares state-of-the-artcontrastive learning methods with the recently introduced masked autoencoderapproach ""SparK"" for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on medical images.Therefore we pre-train on a large unannotated CT image dataset and fine-tune onseveral CT classification tasks.

Most notably, Bayesian agentsdo not face an exploration/exploitation dilemma, a major pathology offrequentist methods. A key challenge for Bayesian RL is the computationalcomplexity of learning Bayes-optimal policies, which is only tractable in toydomains. In this paper we propose a novel model-free approach to address thischallenge. Rather than modelling uncertainty in high-dimensional statetransition distributions as model-based approaches do, we model uncertainty ina one-dimensional Bellman operator. Our theoretical analysis reveals thatexisting model-free approaches either do not propagate epistemic uncertaintythrough the MDP or optimise over a set of contextual policies instead of allhistory-conditioned policies. Both approximations yield policies that can bearbitrarily Bayes-suboptimal. To overcome these issues, we introduce theBayesian exploration network (BEN) which uses normalising flows to model boththe aleatoric uncertainty (via density estimation) and epistemic uncertainty(via variational inference) in the Bellman operator. In the limit of completeoptimisation, BEN learns true Bayes-optimal policies, but like in variationalexpectation-maximisation, partial optimisation renders our approach tractable.Empirical results demonstrate that BEN can learn true Bayes-optimal policies intasks where existing model-free approaches fail.",,,"['New York University', 'cs@robots.ox.ac', 'shimon.whiteson@cs.ox.ac.uk', 'bgk@stern.nyu.edu', 'matthew.fellows@cs.ox.ac']",arXiv,2023-09-21

Thus, in the absence of ways todetermine ground truth, it is important to at least quantify how far from beinginternally consistent a dataset is.

By pre-processing the speech signal it is possible to improve thespeech intelligibility and quality -- this is known as near-end listeningenhancement (NLE). Although, existing NLE techniques are able to greatlyincrease intelligibility in harsh noise environments, in favorable noiseconditions the intelligibility of speech reaches a ceiling where it cannot befurther enhanced. Actually, the focus of existing methods solely on improvingthe intelligibility causes unnecessary processing of the speech signal andleads to speech distortions and quality degradations. In this paper, we providea new rationale for NLE, where the target speech is minimally processed interms of a processing penalty, provided that a certain performance constraint,e.g., intelligibility, is satisfied. We present a closed-form solution for thecase where the performance criterion is an intelligibility estimator based onthe approximated speech intelligibility index and the processing penalty is themean-square error between the processed and the clean speech. This produces anNLE method that adapts to changing noise conditions via a simple gain rule bylimiting the processing to the minimum necessary to achieve a desiredintelligibility, while at the same time focusing on quality in favorable noisesituations by minimizing the amount of speech distortions.

PoSE decouples train length from target context window size bysimulating long inputs using a fixed context window with manipulated positionindices during training. Concretely, we select several short chunks from a longinput sequence, and introduce distinct skipping bias terms to modify theposition indices of each chunk. These bias terms, along with the length of eachchunk, are altered for each training example, allowing the model to adapt toall positions within the target context window without training on full lengthinputs. Experiments show that, compared with fine-tuning on the full length,PoSE greatly reduces memory and time overhead with minimal impact onperformance. Leveraging this advantage, we have successfully extended the LLaMAmodel to 128k tokens. Furthermore, we empirically confirm that PoSE iscompatible with all RoPE-based LLMs and various position interpolationstrategies.

The double-scaled matrix integral has as itsleading density of states the universal Cardy density of primaries in atwo-dimensional CFT, thus motivating the name Virasoro minimal string. Theduality holds for any value of the continuous parameter $c$ and reduces to theJT gravity/matrix integral duality in the large central charge limit. It thusprovides a precise stringy realization of JT gravity. The main observables ofthe Virasoro minimal string are quantum analogues of the Weil-Peterssonvolumes, which are computed as absolutely convergent integrals of worldsheetCFT correlators over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces.By exploiting a relation of the Virasoro minimal string to three-dimensionalgravity and intersection theory on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces, we areable to give a direct derivation of the duality. We provide many checks, suchas explicit numerical - and in special cases, analytic - integration of stringdiagrams, the identification of the CFT boundary conditions with asymptoticboundaries of the two-dimensional spacetime, and the matching between theleading non-perturbative corrections of the worldsheet theory and the matrixintegral.

Focusing on data science applications with expensive objectivefunction evaluations yet inexpensive gradient function evaluations, gradientmethods that never make objective function evaluations are either beingrejuvenated or actively developed. However, as we show, such gradient methodsare all susceptible to catastrophic divergence under realistic conditions fordata science applications. In light of this, gradient methods which make use ofobjective function evaluations become more appealing, yet, as we show, canresult in an exponential increase in objective evaluations between acceptediterates. As a result, existing gradient methods are poorly suited to the needsof optimization problems arising from data science. In this work, we addressthis gap by developing a generic methodology that economically uses objectivefunction evaluations in a problem-driven manner to prevent catastrophicdivergence and avoid an explosion in objective evaluations between acceptediterates. Our methodology allows for specific procedures that can make use ofspecific step size selection methodologies or search direction strategies, andwe develop a novel step size selection methodology that is well-suited to datascience applications. We show that a procedure resulting from our methodologyis highly competitive with standard optimization methods on CUTEst testproblems.

One of theimportant questions in this filed can be formulated as follows: is it true fora $d$-dimensional 2-level polytope that the product of the number of itsvertices and the number of its $d-1$ dimensional facets is bounded by $d2^{d -1}$? Recently, Kupavskii and Weltge~\cite{Kupavskii2020} settled this questionin positive. A key element in their proof is a more general result for familiesof vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that the scalar product between any twovectors from different families is either $0$ or $1$.Peter Frankl noted that, when restricted to the Boolean cube, the solutionboils down to an elegant application of the Harris--Kleitman correlationinequality. Meanwhile, this problem becomes much more sophisticated when weconsider several families.Let $\mathcal{F}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{F}_\ell$ be families of subsets of $\{1,\ldots, n\}$. We suppose that for distinct $k, k'$ and arbitrary $F_1 \in\mathcal{F}_{k}, F_2 \in \mathcal{F}_{k'}$ we have $|F_1 \cap F_2|\leqslant m.$We are interested in the maximal value of $|\mathcal{F}_1|\ldots|\mathcal{F}_\ell|$ and the structure of the extremal example.In the previous paper on the topic, the authors found the asymptotics of thisproduct for constant $\ell$ and $m$ as $n$ tends to infinity. However, thepossible structure of the families from the extremal example turned out to bevery complicated.

We develop efficientmethods for synthesizing circuits realizing any desired energy-conservingunitary using XX+YY interaction with or without single-qubit rotations aroundthe z-axis. Interestingly, implementing generic energy-conserving unitaries,such as CCZ and Fredkin gates, with 2-local energy-conserving gates requiresthe use of ancilla qubits. When single-qubit rotations around the z-axis arepermitted, our scheme requires only a single ancilla qubit, whereas with theXX+YY interaction alone, it requires 2 ancilla qubits. In addition to exactrealizations, we also consider approximate realizations and show how a generalenergy-conserving unitary can be synthesized using only a sequence of$\sqrt{iSWAP}$ gates and 2 ancillary qubits, with arbitrarily small error,which can be bounded via the Solovay-Kitaev theorem.

Using the formalism of symplectic duality, we derive anexpression for the generating function of twisted quasimap invariants in termsof the character of a certain tilting module on the periodic coulomb branch.

A new approach for constructing$\widetilde{X}$ (henceforth, NA) has been introduced in \cite{JSPI}. NA hasessentially three advantages: (i) To build $\widetilde{X}$ is straightforward;(ii) The joint distribution of $(X,\widetilde{X})$ can be written in closedform; (iii) $\widetilde{X}$ is often optimal under various criteria. However,for NA to apply, $X_1,\ldots, X_p$ should be conditionally independent givensome random element $Z$. Our first result is that any probability measure $\mu$on $\mathbb{R}^p$ can be approximated by a probability measure $\mu_0$ of theform $$\mu_0\bigl(A_1\times\ldots\times A_p\bigr)=E\Bigl\{\prod_{i=1}^pP(X_i\in A_i\mid Z)\Bigr\}.$$ The approximation is in total variation distancewhen $\mu$ is absolutely continuous, and an explicit formula for $\mu_0$ isprovided. If $X\sim\mu_0$, then $X_1,\ldots,X_p$ are conditionally independent.Hence, with a negligible error, one can assume $X\sim\mu_0$ and build$\widetilde{X}$ through NA. Our second result is a characterization of theknockoffs $\widetilde{X}$ obtained via NA. It is shown that $\widetilde{X}$ isof this type if and only if the pair $(X,\widetilde{X})$ can be extended to aninfinite sequence so as to satisfy certain invariance conditions. The basictool for proving this fact is de Finetti's theorem for partially exchangeablesequences. In addition to the quoted results, an explicit formula for theconditional distribution of $\widetilde{X}$ given $X$ is obtained in a fewcases. In one of such cases, it is assumed $X_i\in\{0,1\}$ for all $i$.",,,"['SC', 'UK']",arXiv,2023-09-21

To illustrate theflexibility of the FAD framework we consider several other methods. in certainasymptotic limits, these methods can be viewed as introducing cubic damping invarious forms; they can be more efficient than linearly dissipated Hamiltoniandynamics in common optimization settings.We present details of the numerical methods and show convergence for both thecontinuous and discretized dynamics in the convex setting by constructingLyapunov functions. The methods are tested using a toy model (the Rosenbrockfunction). We also demonstrate the methods for structural optimization foratomic clusters in Lennard--Jones and Morse potentials. The experiments showthe relative efficiency and robustness of FAD in comparison to linearlydissipated Hamiltonian dynamics.",,,"['SC', 'katerinakaron@gmail.com', 'RIC', 'b.leimkuhler@ed.ac.uk', 'gabriel.stoltz@enpc.fr', 'OC', 'IC']",arXiv,2023-09-21

Once learned, the neuronal input classificationis executed without voluntary or conscious control, enabling hierarchicalincremental learning of classifications that is effective in our inherentlyclassifiable world.

This new object has zero conformal weight and isgiven by $\phi^{2/\Delta}g_{\mu \nu}$, where ($-\Delta$) is the conformaldimension of the scalar. As $g_{\mu \nu}$ has conformal dimension of 2, theresulting tensor is trivially a conformal invariant. Then, the generatedscalar-tensor theory, which we call the Weyl uplift of the original purelymetric theory, is obtained by replacing the metric by $\hat{g}_{\mu \nu}$ inthe action that defines the original theory. This prescription allowed us todefine the Weyl uplift of theories with terms of higher order in the Riemanniancurvature. Furthermore, the prescription for scalar-tensor theories coming fromterms that have explicit covariant derivatives in the Lagrangian is discussed.The same mechanism can also be used for the derivation of the equations ofmotion of the scalar-tensor theory from the original field equations in theEinstein frame.

First, we observe that the flux superpotentialinduces a huge scalar potential having a total of 76276 terms involving 128flux parameters and 14 real scalars. Subsequently, we invoke a new set of (theso-called) ""axionic fluxes"" comprising combinations of the standard fluxes andthe RR axions, and it turns out that these axionic fluxes can be very useful inrewriting the scalar potential in a relatively compact form. In this regard,using the metric of the compactifying toroidal sixfold, we present a newformulation of the effective scalar potential, which might be useful forunderstanding the higher-dimensional origin of the various pieces via theso-called ""dimensional oxidation"" process.

1074,2302.13325,['Samuel Rey'],Signal Processing (eess.SP),Robust Network Topology Inference and Processing of Graph Signals,"The abundance of large and heterogeneous systems is rendering contemporarydata more pervasive, intricate, and with a non-regular structure. Withclassical techniques facing troubles to deal with the irregular (non-Euclidean)domain where the signals are defined, a popular approach at the heart of graphsignal processing (GSP) is to: (i) represent the underlying support via a graphand (ii) exploit the topology of this graph to process the signals at hand. Inaddition to the irregular structure of the signals, another critical limitationis that the observed data is prone to the presence of perturbations, which, inthe context of GSP, may affect not only the observed signals but also thetopology of the supporting graph. Ignoring the presence of perturbations, alongwith the couplings between the errors in the signal and the errors in theirsupport, can drastically hinder estimation performance. While many GSP workshave looked at the presence of perturbations in the signals, much fewer havelooked at the presence of perturbations in the graph, and almost none at theirjoint effect. While this is not surprising (GSP is a relatively new field), weexpect this to change in the upcoming years. Motivated by the previousdiscussion, the goal of this thesis is to advance toward a robust GSP paradigmwhere the algorithms are carefully designed to incorporate the influence ofperturbations in the graph signals, the graph support, and both. To do so, weconsider different types of perturbations, evaluate their disruptive impact onfundamental GSP tasks, and design robust algorithms to address them.",,,[],arXiv,2023-09-21

Further, sensing matrices that constitute a Parseval tight frameresult in minimum mean-squared-error (MSE) reconstruction given oracleknowledge of the support of the sparse vector. However, if the sensing matrixis not tight, could one achieve the reconstruction performance assured by atight frame by suitably designing the reconstruction strategy? This is the keyquestion that we address in this paper. We develop a novel formulation thatrelies on a generalized l2-norm-based data-fidelity loss that tightens thesensing matrix, along with the standard l1 penalty for enforcing sparsity. Theoptimization is performed using proximal gradient method, resulting in thetight-frame iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (TF-ISTA). We show thatthe objective convergence of TF-ISTA is linear akin to that of ISTA.Incorporating Nesterovs momentum into TF-ISTA results in a faster variant,namely, TF-FISTA, whose objective convergence is quadratic, akin to that ofFISTA. We provide performance guarantees on the l2-error for the proposedformulation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms offersuperior sparse recovery performance and faster convergence. Proceedingfurther, we develop the network variants of TF-ISTA and TF-FISTA, wherein aconvolutional neural network is used as the sparsifying operator. On theapplication front, we consider compressed sensing image recovery (CSIR).Experimental results on Set11, BSD68, Urban100, and DIV2K datasets show thatthe proposed models outperform state-of-the-art sparse recovery methods, withperformance measured in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) andstructural similarity index metric (SSIM).",,,[],arXiv,2023-09-21

Itexplores the benefits of incorporating pupillary activity measures to improvemethods that lead to an understanding of cognitive processing and performanceevaluation. The estimation of cognitive load using pupil diameter typicallyinvolves measures relative to a baseline. Instead, we conducted an eye-trackingstudy using the Low/High Index of Pupillary Activity to evaluate healthcareexperts and non-experts analyzing the faces with and without pain from adataset of newborn faces. This data was recorded by the Tobii TX300eye-tracking system in a closed room with controlled lighting. Our contributionis to introduce the LHIPA calculation considering the areas of interestsegments of the pupil diameter signal. The results suggest that the visualattention reflected by the traditional metrics may not correspond directly tothe respective cognitive load for both sample groups of participants.",,,[],arXiv,2023-09-21

This investigationproposes an efficient method of data processing for the statisticalquantification of cloud features using infrared images and global solarirradiance measurements. The infrared images and the global solar irradiancemeasurements are acquired using a sky imager equipped with a commerciallow-cost long-wave infrared radiometric camera and a pyranometer. The enclosureof the infrared camera is mounted on a solar tracker so that the Sun stays inthe center of images throughout the day. We explain how to removecyclostationary biases in global solar irradiance measurements. Seasonal trendsare removed from the global solar irradiance time series, using the theoreticalglobal solar irradiance to obtain the clear sky index time series. We introducean atmospheric model to remove the effect of atmospheric scattering and theeffect of the Sun's direct irradiance from infrared images. Scattering isproduced by water spots and dust particles on the germanium lens of the cameraenclosure. We explain how to remove the scattering effect produced by thegermanium lens attached to the data acquisition system enclosure window of theinfrared camera. An atmospheric condition model classifies the sky conditionsin four different categories: clear sky, cumulus, stratus and nimbus. When aninfrared image is classified in the category of clear sky, it is used to modelthe scattering effect produced by the germanium lens.",,,[],arXiv,2023-09-21

In this study, we present a regularization method, referredto as structure sparsity (SS) regularization, for denoising in NLOSreconstruction. By exploiting the prior knowledge of structure sparseness, weincorporate nuclear norm penalization into the cost function of directionallight-cone transform (DLCT) model for NLOS imaging system. This incorporationeffectively integrates the neighborhood information associated with thedirectional albedo, thereby facilitating the denoising process. Subsequently,the reconstruction is achieved by optimizing a directional albedo model with SSregularization using fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. Notably,the robust reconstruction of occluded objects is observed. Throughcomprehensive evaluations conducted on both synthetic and experimentaldatasets, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields high-qualityreconstructions, surpassing the state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms,especially in scenarios involving short exposure and low SNR measurements.",,,"['UA', 'UO', 'HU', 'State', 'RU', 'chenr@mail.sysu', 'LC', ' State']",arXiv,2023-09-21
