3enxf,['Philip Deming'],['Psychiatry'],Burning neuroscientific questions about etiological models of psychopathy,"Numerous etiological models have been proposed for psychopathy, a disorder that leaves a devastating impact on society. There is a need for developing treatments that target the relevant mechanisms proposed by these models. But first, there is a need to refine the etiological models. Toward this aim, I pose three questions guided by what is known about the architecture of the human brain, and how that architecture shapes function. In question 1, I ask whether the paralimbic hypothesis implicates the whole brain. Given its myelo- and cytoarchitecture, paralimbic cortex sits atop multiple neural hierarchies. This position allows paralimbic cortex to send feedback signals down these hierarchies, shaping sensory signals from the body and world before they arrive. In question 2, I ask what the low fear theory predicts about brain function. Most previous neuroscientific applications of this theory have posited low amygdala activity as the brain basis of psychopathic individuals’ purported fearlessness. I emphasize the need for a new neuroscientific application of the low fear theory, one that accounts for the distributed and context-specific brain activity that creates fear. In question 3, I ask how the brain creates goal states, and I explore implications for two models of psychopathy that assign a prominent role to goal states. Evidence from the field of reinforcement learning shows that the brain adaptively employs a spectrum of behavioral control strategies, ranging from model-free (i.e., habitual) to model-based (i.e., goal-directed). Psychopathic people may have difficulty adaptively implementing primarily model-based strategies.",https://psyarxiv.com/3enxf/,2023-09-21T22:29:11.846828,"['Northeastern University', 'NEU', 'DC', 'p.deming@northeastern.edu', 'State', 'Cal', 'UK', 'SC', 'USA', 'Brown', ' State']",OSF

Associations Between Momentary Self-Esteem, Daily Social Interactions, and Self-Esteem Development in Late Adolescence and Late Adulthood","Research over the past two decades has repeatedly shown that the evaluation of one’s own worth—trait self-esteem—is closely linked to the quality of social relationships and perceptions of social inclusion. However, there is limited evidence on the dynamics between momentary self-esteem and perceptions of social inclusion in everyday life, as well as on their possible long-term (bottom-up) effects on the development of trait self-esteem. We addressed this research gap using longitudinal data from a German multi-methodological study (N = 324) in which N = 235 late adolescents (Mage = 17.7; 76% female) and N = 89 older adults (Mage = 63.8; 64% female) were followed over one year. Based on three trait questionnaires with six-month intervals and a 7-day experience-sampling burst at the first measurement point, we investigated momentary dynamics in self-esteem and longitudinal change by using multilevel and latent growth modeling. Results confirmed the positive association between momentary self-esteem and perceptions of social inclusion in everyday life, that is, self-esteem reactivity in both age groups. In addition, both self- and other reports showed a consistent increase in trait self-esteem over one year. However, because the slope parameters did not indicate substantial interindividual variance, we were unable to test for bottom-up effects of self-esteem reactivity. We discuss the importance of daily social experiences for momentary self-esteem in late adolescence and late adulthood, but also point to the need for further multi-methodological research.",https://psyarxiv.com/rzbq9/,2023-09-21T20:38:19.575369,['ND'],OSF

Increased autocorrelation (AR) of system-specific measures has been suggested as a predictor for critical transitions in complex systems. Increased AR of mood scores has been reported to anticipate depressive episodes in major depressive disorder, while other studies found AR increases to be associated with depressive episodes themselves. Data on AR in patients with bipolar disorders (BD) is limited and inconclusive.

Methods. Patients with BD reported their current mood via daily e-diaries for 12 months. Current affective status (euthymic, prodromal, depressed, (hypo)manic) was assessed in 26 bi-weekly expert interviews. Exploratory analyses tested whether self-reported current mood and AR of the same item could differentiate between prodromal phases or affective episodes and euthymia.

Results. A total of 29 depressive and 20 (hypo)manic episodes were observed in 29 participants with BD. Self-reported current mood was significantly decreased during in the two weeks prior to a depressive episode (early prodromal, late prodromal), but not changed prior to manic episodes. The AR was neither a significant predictor for the early or late prodromal phase of depression, nor for the early prodromal phase of (hypo)mania. Decreased AR was found in the late prodromal phase of (hypo)mania. Increased AR was mainly found during depressive episodes. 

Conclusions.  AR changes might not be better at predicting depressive episodes than simple self-report measures on current mood in patients with BD. Increased AR was mostly found during depressive episodes. Potentially, changes in AR might anticipate (hypo)manic episodes.",https://psyarxiv.com/8ebmc/,2023-09-21T19:52:07.403317,"['Vera.Ludwig@ukdd.de', 'Central']",OSF

While the ability to remember the general idea or gist of past episodes is relatively preserved from the effects of aging, the ability to remember the verbatim details of these episodes declines. The aim of the present study was to examine whether age-related differences in the quality of episodic representations could be reduced by manipulations of information encoding. Two experiments were conducted with younger adults (N = 63, 18-27 years old) and older adults (N = 61, 54-81 years old) in which either the retrieval of gist representations of studied items was facilitated by presenting items that could be grouped within the same category (Experiment 1) or the retrieval of verbatim details of studied items was facilitated by presenting the same items repeatedly (Experiment 2). Both manipulations proved effective in increasing retrieval of either gist or verbatim representations in a recognition task in younger and older adults. Increasing gist retrieval improved correct recognition performance for both younger and older adults, but also led the latter to make more recognition errors. Increasing verbatim retrieval improved correct recognition performance for both younger and older adults, and the gain was greater for older adults. These findings support the notion that age-related changes in episodic memory can be explained by changes in representational specificity and suggest that simple encoding manipulations could improve episodic memory in older adults.",https://psyarxiv.com/djt9v/,2023-09-21T19:42:43.865344,"['MU', 'BU', 'Pitt', 'PC']",OSF

Despite the proclaimed goal to develop a democracy based on market principles and sound regulatory principles, Serbia's regulatory state appears to remain unconsolidated. The research reveals deviations from the key principles of the regulatory state, such as the government's non-interference in markets and commitment to Better Regulation guidelines. During the transition period from 2001 to 2023, Serbia's regulatory approach has blended various elements, including features of the developmental state. To grasp the trajectory of the regulatory state's lack of consolidation, decay, reversal, and replacement, we need to consider a consolidation perspective in addition to the prevalent ‘modelling perspective’. The latter mainly distinguishes between the ‘Regulatory State of the South’ and the ‘Regulatory State of the Global North’. The observed lack of consolidation in Serbia's case study calls for a rethinking of theories on internationalisation and trends in global governance's transnationalisation. It implies the possibility of the rise of varied regulatory models, even in countries close to the Global North and within the EU's neighbourhood, diverging from the traditional regulatory state paradigm. This study adds to the conversation on regulatory state frameworks and sheds light on the intricate paths and potential futures of regulatory states in countries undergoing transition.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7g9zx/,2023-09-21T22:44:10.784438,"['ognjen.dragicevic@fpn.bg.ac.rs', ' State', 'slobodan.tomic@york.ac.uk', 'State', 'UK']",OSF

The analysis compares legislation from three countries in Southeast Europe: Serbia, North Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It examines whether two key components of legal design, namely (i) the discretion granted to institutions within the criminal justice system and political establishment and (ii) the presence of checks and balances systems within MLA procedures, have a positive or negative impact on MLA policy in practice. The analysis reveals that, although the three countries share many similarities in their legal arrangements pertaining to MLA procedures, there are some variations in specific forms of MLA, in terms of the discretion granted to domestic actors and the presence of checks and balances within the procedure. The findings show that significant discretion given to specific actors within the MLA policy can pave the way for harmful practices such as arbitrariness, uneven application of the law, and potential political abuse. The study also highlights the value of incorporating built-in checks and balances within the MLA procedure to ensure accountability and mutual control mechanisms, confirming that, where such mechanisms are not present, appropriate accountability and control safeguards are missing, enabling potential abuse of power or neglect in handling the MLA procedure. At the same time, it emerges that these checks and balances, whether they include internal review mechanisms, joint decision-making models, and/or approval powers ('de facto vetoing'), should not be excessive or burdensome to avoid obstructing the MLA processes.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5zfmg/,2023-09-21T22:48:42.366159,"['Western', 'slobodan.tomic@york.ac.uk', 'E.David-Barrett@sussex.ac.uk', 'UK']",OSF

All humans rely on social learning to acquire culture, but there is substantial variation across societies, between individuals and over developmental time. However, it is unclear why these differences exist. Here, we present an evolutionary model showing that individual variation in social learning can emerge if the benefits of social learning are unpredictable. Unpredictability selects for flexible developmental programmes that allow individuals to update their reliance on social learning based on previous experiences. This developmental flexibility, in turn, causes some individuals in a population to end up consistently relying more heavily on social learning than others. We demonstrate this core evolutionary mechanism across three scenarios of increasing complexity, investigating the impact of different sources of uncertainty about the usefulness of social learning. Our results show how evolution can shape how individuals learn to learn from others, with potentially profound effects on cultural diversity.",https://psyarxiv.com/gxubv/,2023-09-21T18:26:33.244261,['KU'],OSF

There is a persistent delay in leaving the parental home, particularly among women, who leave at similar ages as men in recent cohorts. Leaving home for marriage has decreased, replaced by cohabitation and independent living. A substantial social class gradient is evident in the timing of leaving home, particularly for women. Social class disparities also extend to patterns of leaving home for marriage or living alone, whereas cohabitation shows less class differentiation. Children of the working class are more likely to leave home for marriage than those from the service class and daughters from families with no employment history or deceased parents at younger ages.

In addition, emotional states, such as anxiety, shape our visual systems, increasing overall, and particularly threat-related, sensitivity. It remains unclear, however, how anxiety interacts with additional cues when categorizing sensory input. This is especially important in social scenarios where ambiguous gestures are commonplace, thus requiring the integration of cues for a proper interpretation. To this end, we decided to assess how states of anxiety might bias the perception of potentially aggressive social interactions, and how external cues are incorporated in this process. Participants (N = 71) were tasked with signalling the presence of aggression in ambiguous social interactions. Simultaneously, an observer (facial expression) reacted (by showing an emotional expression) to this interaction. Importantly, participants performed this task under safety and threat of shock conditions. Decision measures and eye tracking data were collected. Our results showed that threat of shock did not affect sensitivity nor criterion when detecting aggressive interactions. The same pattern was observed for response times. Drift diffusion modelling analysis, however, suggested quicker evidence accumulation when under threat. Lastly, dwell times over the observer were higher when under threat, indicating a possible association between anxiety states and a bias towards potentially threat-related indicators.

differed across multiple characteristics consistent with the simple view of reading: poor
decoders, poor comprehenders, poor readers, and good readers. Over a school year, different
instructional foci showed differential effectiveness for students in these different profiles. An
instructional focus on vocabulary primarily benefited good readers at the expense of poor
decoders and poor comprehenders, while a focus on advanced reading abilities benefitted
poor comprehenders at the expense of poor decoders and good readers. These findings are in
contrast to those obtained by multiple regression, which, because they focused on only one
learner characteristic at a time, would have suggested different and potentially misleading
implications for instruction. Thus, this study provides initial evidence for the advantages of a
person-centered approach to examining differential effectiveness.",https://psyarxiv.com/9bwqg/,2023-09-21T14:03:34.122270,['l.tetzlaff@dipf.de'],OSF

One of its less recognized effects, however, lies in perception alterations caused by how one weighs sensory evidence, that in turn might affect social communication. Here, we investigated how anxiety affects our ability to gather and use social cues to anticipate the action of others. We adapted a paradigm to assess expectations in social scenarios, whereby participants were asked to identify the presence of agents therein, while supported by action cues (communicative vs individual actions) from another agent. Participants (N=66) underwent this task under safe and threat-of-shock block conditions. We extracted criterion and sensitivity measures to evaluate participants’ response patterns. Gaze data was also collected. Our analysis showed that whilst the type of action had the expected effect (i.e., lower criterion for communicative actions), threat-of-shock had no effect over any response measurements. Furthermore, eye tracker data revealed no differences in dwell time across conditions when searching for cues but showed that, under threat, participants exhibited shorter fixation durations.

Encoding associations in memory tends to be a more difficult task than item encoding as associative memory requires encoding multiple items as well as the specific links amongst the items. Associative memory has been shown to require cortical medial temporal lobe (MTL) engagement, to process context and item information, respectively, in addition to hippocampal engagement that is needed for the binding of distinct information. The need to engage greater and more disparate neural resources in order to execute associative encoding tasks often comes at a cost with respect to memory success, notably, there is poorer associative memory compared to item memory performance. Accordingly, researchers have worked to identify interventions and strategies aimed at reducing the effort and neural resources required for successful associative memory processing. One such means of support is the concept of unitization. Unitization has traditionally been defined as the process by which two or more discrete items are processed, or encoded, such that they are perceived as a single ensemble. The current review will explore the neural research on unitization while taking into account the behavioral benefits that accompany the process.",https://psyarxiv.com/sbyr2/,2023-09-21T12:53:10.807712,"['Penn', 'NEU', ' State', 'Pennsylvania State University', 'State', 'IC', 'SC', 'Penn State', 'CMC', 'HC']",OSF

As a consequence, a conservation incentive exists to stress inter-population differences to define taxa, potentially leading to taxonomic inflation. But stressing the uniqueness of threatened populations has the side effect of hindering conservation actions that promote inter-population gene flow, such as genetic rescue. These actions may be of critical importance for severely inbred populations involved in extinction vortices, for which an inflated taxonomy can become a conservation trap. Here, we exemplify this scenario with the western capercaillie population in the Cantabrian Mountains, described and legally listed as a subspecies not supported by recent molecular data. The Cantabrian capercaillie population is Critically Endangered after a long-lasting decline and a recent demographic collapse. It shows clear signs of inbreeding depression, including striking clutch size decreases as well as reduced hatchability and chick survival. This critical situation could be alleviated through a genetic rescue, but this possibility is hindered by inertias rooted in the putative uniqueness of the Cantabrian capercaillie. It had been previously argued that poor taxonomy could hamper conservation, through the oblivion of populations deserving, but not having, a taxonomic status. We show that taxonomic inflation can also become an obstacle for effective conservation.",https://osf.io/jfg7v/,2023-09-21T13:18:42.034351,"['ODU', 'miguelclavero@ebd.csic.es', 'IC', 'UC']",OSF

Mapping Attention to Spatial Dimensions of Environmental Degradation in Parliamentary Speeches,"Over the past few decades, the public debate on environmental issues has changed from a discussion primarily focused on local environmental degradation to a discourse in which global environmental issues and those affecting the environment abroad have gained increasing levels of attention. The links between local environmental degradation and global economic dynamics have become increasingly visible. However, in political debates, some parties tend to ignore the international dimension of environmental issues, while others appear to increase their attention to this topic. Who are the parties that focus on the international dimension of environmental degradation and why? Are (traditional) economic left/right positions a meaningful predictor of parties' willingness to focus on international rather than domestic environmental issues? In this study, I map the attention to domestic and international environmental issues in parliamentary speeches and examine the factors that drive it. To this end, I employ a quantitative text analysis of speeches in the British House of Commons and the German Bundestag between 1991 and 2018. My findings indicate that the (traditional) economic left-right alignment does not influence attention to the international dimension of environmental issues, whereas the sociocultural left-right alignment does. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the party system affects the direction of the effects. In the multi-party system of Germany, socioculturally left-leaning parties speak more about international environmental issues, whereas right instead of left-leaning parties do the same in the two-party system of the United Kingdom. The findings imply that future research should take a closer look at the party system and country-specific factors when examining how parties speak about the environment in parliamentary debates.",https://osf.io/kpvjh/,2023-09-21T12:55:49.634170,[],OSF

The target of the feedback intervention was varied between subjects: Students either received (1) feedback on metacognitive aspects, (2) feedback on motivational aspects, (3) feedback on metacognitive and motivational aspects, (4) or no feedback. Within the three feedback groups, we additionally varied feedback content from day to day within-subjects. Students either received (1) informative feedback on self-regulated learning (2) directive feedback including only a strategy suggestion, (3) transformative feedback including feedback on self-regulated learning and a strategy suggestion, (4) or – on some days – no feedback. Results revealed that informative, directive, and transformative informative feedback reduced students’ procrastination and improved daily self-monitoring, adherence to time schedules, and goal achievement compared to receiving no feedback. Informative and transformative feedback additionally improved planning strategies and concentration. Motivation and self-efficacy were unaffected by any kind of feedback. The positive effects of the intervention were most pronounced when students received feedback on metacognitive and motivational aspects. Moreover, students in the feedback groups achieved better grades in the examinations compared students in the control group. Together, results indicate that the feedback intervention effectively improved students’ self-regulated learning and achievement.

Yet, despite extensive research on politicians’ use of social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, TikTok’s distinct platform-specific languages and features have received limited attention. Its short video clips, algorithmic content recommendations, and mobile-first interface present new challenges and opportunities for politicians aiming to communicate effectively with society. This paper addresses this gap by providing a first examination of the ways in which U.S. politicians embrace and adapt to the TikTok platform. Employing a multimodal approach that studies video, text, and audio, we collect and analyse a novel dataset of TikTok videos created by U.S. Governors and Members of Congress to understand how they use comedic, documentary, communal, explanatory, interactive, and meta communication styles to connect with their audience. Our analyses reveal that U.S. politicians primarily use TikTok as a platform to communicate about political issues, often adopting explanatory and documentary styles to articulate their policies. However, the comedic style significantly boosts engagement, especially for female politicians, who see a fourfold increase in engagement when producing comedic content compared to male counterparts. This presents a challenge for politicians: balancing humor's allure with the seriousness expected from them. Our findings provide valuable insights into digital political communication on emerging platforms like TikTok and the role of multiple message modalities in harnessing online attention and engagement.",https://osf.io/g8dbu/,2023-09-21T09:18:53.671335,['umansky@ipz.uzh.ch'],OSF

Using in-depth, semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, this study investigated the factors affecting the perceptions of neighborhood safety of 25 parents and their adolescent children (aged 12 to 17 years) from low-income families. The study also aimed to explore if there were differences in perceptions of neighborhood safety between participants residing in purchased public housing and participants residing in public rental housing. Findings revealed that participants residing in public rental housing perceived their neighborhood as more dangerous than participants residing in purchased housing, which contributed to their isolation from the community. In contrast, participants from purchased housing mentioned that social cohesion and a sense of trust with their neighbors contributed to their sense of safety. Our findings suggest that close bonds and greater social cohesion among neighbors could be a possible factor to target in improving the safety perceptions of families residing in public rental housing.",https://psyarxiv.com/ek9uf/,2023-09-21T09:12:03.385579,['smtoh@childrensociety.org.sg'],OSF

Our findings revealed that while informed participants adjusted their beliefs about bots' behavior, their actual decisions remained largely unaffected.

In this paper, we aim to improve our understanding of the IDS preference and its boundary conditions by combining and comparing these two data sources across key population and design characteristics of the underlying studies. Our analyses reveal that both the meta-analysis and multi-lab replication show moderate effect sizes (d = 0.35 for both estimates) and that both of these effects persist when relevant study-level moderators are added to the models (i.e., experimental methods, infant ages, and native languages). However, while the overall effect size estimates were similar, the two sources diverged in the effects of key moderators: both infant age and experimental method predicted IDS preference in the multi-lab replication study, but showed no effect in the meta-analysis. These results demonstrate that the IDS preference generalizes across a variety of experimental conditions and sampling characteristics, while simultaneously identifying key differences in the empirical picture offered by each source individually and pinpointing areas where substantial uncertainty remains about the influence of theoretically central moderators on IDS preference.

This study investigated levels of drug adulteration and substitution in drugs purchased by Australians from cryptomarkets.
Methods.
Data were collected from the Dread subforum /d/Test4Pay from 1/9/2022 to 23/8/2023. Posts were included if they reported the results of drug samples submitted by post to the Vancouver-based Get Your Drugs Tested service, which uses Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) with immunoassay strip tests (fentanyl and benzodiazepines).
Results.
Out of 103 samples, 65% contained only the advertised substance, 14% contained the advertised substance in combination with other psychoactive and/or potentially harmful substances, and for 21%, the advertised substance was absent. MDMA, methamphetamine and heroin were consistently found to contain only the advertised substance, while 2C-B, alprazolam and ketamine were the most likely to be completely substituted. Only one-fifth (21%) of cocaine samples contained solely the advertised substance, with 68% of the samples containing cocaine with adulterants like lidocaine, creatine, levamisole, and boric acid. No fentanyl contamination was detected. Different novel dissociatives and novel benzodiazepines were detected, as well as a nitazene compound.
Discussion and Conclusions.
Drug markets under prohibition continue to contain numerous unexpected substances, some of which can elevate risk of harm dramatically for consumers. Cryptomarkets are not immune to this problem, despite review systems which should in theory make vendors more accountable for the quality of their stock.

Little is known about how older children learn to read for the first time. Importantly, procedural learning supports children’s ability to acquire new skills implicitly and apply those skills with automaticity. Procedural learning is therefore thought to support early reading and reading-related skills, such as phonological awareness. However, as children age they may become less reliant on procedural learning. Older children learn new language skills through largely explicit memorization as opposed to implicit procedural learning, and the same is potentially true for language adjacent skills such as reading. Older children may rely less on procedurally supported phonological awareness when reading for the first time and instead rely on explicit skills such as vocabulary. We examined the role of procedural learning in emergent reading across different ages (9-15 years), focusing on low-literacy communities in rural Côte d’Ivoire, where many children remain in emergent stages of reading even at the end of primary school and age for grade is highly variable.

Background
Pigtail drainage catheters are essential tools in medical interventions that require the drainage of fluid collections from bodily cavities. Two commonly employed designs feature punched holes and skived holes. Despite the prevalence of these catheters in clinical set- tings, little research exists to compare the efficiency of the two-hole designs in terms of fluid dynamics and clinical applicability.
Objective
The primary objective of this study is to thoroughly investigate and compare the fluid dynamics characteristics and efficiency of pigtail drainage catheters with skived holes and punched holes. This study aims to quantify the effects of these hole designs on shear stress, turbulence, and volumetric flow rates, providing insight into the potential clinical implica- tions.
Methods
To achieve this, we employed a multi-modal approach incorporating both computational and experimental methods. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was employed to simulate the flow of fluid through each catheter design. This model solved the Navier-Stokes equations numerically to produce detailed velocity and pressure profiles.[1]
An experimental setup mimicking in vivo conditions was also used, where catheters with both hole types were inserted into a fluid chamber filled with a viscous fluid resembling human biological fluid.

Key Findings 
Our results indicate that catheters with skived holes demonstrate significantly lower shear stress and turbulence when compared to catheters with punched holes. Furthermore, catheters featuring skived holes achieved higher volumetric flow rates, signifying more effi- cient drainage capabilities.
Clinical Implications
The skived hole design, through its effects on fluid dynamics, appears to offer superior performance in terms of drainage efficacy. The reduced shear stress and turbulence could lead to less clogging, potentially extending the lifespan of the catheter. This has significant implications for long-term drainage scenarios, offering both cost and clinical advantages.
Conclusion
Our findings strongly suggest that the design of holes in pigtail drainage catheters plays    a crucial role in determining drainage efficacy, with skived holes offering distinct advantages in terms of fluid dynamics and overall performance. Further in-vivo studies are required to confirm these observations.",https://osf.io/f6km4/,2023-09-20T20:16:52.500044,['pstibbs@risimaging.com'],OSF

Here we first examine to what extent different theories are commensurable (or comparable) along particular dimensions. We posit logical (and, when applicable, empirical) commensurability as a necessary condition for identifying common denominators among different theories. By consequence, dimensions for inclusion in a set of logically and empirically commensurable theories of consciousness can be proposed. Next, we compare a limited subset of neuroscience-based theories in terms of commensurability. This analysis does not yield a denominator that might serve to define a minimally unifying model of consciousness. Theories that seem to be akin by one denominator can be remote by another. We suggest a methodology of comparing different theories via multiple probing questions, allowing to discern overall (dis)similarities between theories.

By integrating the bootstrap into these key aspects, this framework avoids several pitfalls one may encounter with the conventional approach and enables a more informative investigation of latent class structures within organizational research. Two Monte Carlo simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the bootstrapped extensions of Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) in model selection, as well as the usefulness of bootstrap selection rates in capturing model selection uncertainty.

Moreover, different criteria can result in different optimal models, making it challenging to reach a consensus on the best criterion.

These techniques have been pivotal in the success of various applications, from image recognition to natural language processing. In this article, we will delve into the fundamentals of transfer learning and pre-trained models, exploring their significance and impact in the world of artificial intelligence.

The Essence of Transfer Learning
At its core, transfer learning is a machine learning technique that leverages knowledge gained from one task to improve the performance of another related task. Think of it as transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain. In traditional machine learning, models are trained from scratch for each specific task. Transfer learning, on the other hand, takes a different approach—it capitalizes on the idea that what a model learns from one task can be beneficially applied to a different but related task.

The motivation behind transfer learning is simple yet profound. Imagine training a deep neural network to recognize thousands of everyday objects, such as cats, dogs, and cars. This is a resource-intensive process that typically requires vast amounts of labeled data and significant computational power. Now, consider that you want to build a model to distinguish between different breeds of dogs, a task closely related to recognizing dogs in general. Instead of starting from scratch, you can use the knowledge the model gained from recognizing dogs to jumpstart the breed classification task. This is the essence of transfer learning.",https://osf.io/9p7jv/,2023-09-20T17:54:29.556100,"['ND', 'IC', 'Cal', 'UK', 'UT', 'SC', 'AU', 'USA', 'ENC']",OSF

In this study we examined the possibility that this LVF for visual processing of consonant-vowel strings may be a consequence of repetition by examining perceptual biases in analogous auditory and visual tasks for both consonant-vowel strings and words. We replicated opposite perceptual biases for consonant-vowel strings (RE and LVF advantages). This did not extend to word stimuli where we found RE and RVF advantages. Furthermore, these perceptual biases did not differ across three experimental blocks. Thus, we can firmly conclude that this LVF is unique to consonant-vowel strings and is not a consequence of the repetition of a relatively limited number of stimuli. Finally, a test of covariances indicated cross-modal relationships between laterality indices suggesting that perceptual biases are dissociable within individuals and cluster on mode of presentation (auditory vs. visual).",https://psyarxiv.com/jb4v3/,2023-09-20T17:10:01.028345,"['adam_parker@ucl.ac.uk', 'Bona', 'WC', 'UC']",OSF

Although HFAs have minimal impact on ozone depletion, their global warming potential (GWP) is more than 1,000 times higher than CO2, bringing them in scope for restriction under the F-Gas Regulation in the European Union (EU). The pharmaceutical industry is developing solutions, including a near-zero GWP ‘next-generation propellant,’ HFO-1234ze(E). At the same time, the EU is also evaluating a restriction on per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) regulation. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is a persistent PFAS and a potential degradation product of HFO-1234ze(E).

Traditional public engagement methods are often face-to-face, such as town halls, public forums, and workshops. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, these approaches were rendered ineffective due to health risks and the engagement process saw a shift towards virtual meetings. While accessible to a broader audience, virtual public meetings introduced challenges around limited time and opportunity for attendees to share feedback. Furthermore, attendees were often required to identify themselves, potentially discouraging reticent attendees from speaking up and risking confrontations with other attendees. To mitigate this issue, we designed and developed CommunityClick-Virtual, a multi-modal companion web application that allows virtual meeting participants to provide feedback on meeting discussions silently and anonymously using six customizable options or through chat messages without the need to speak up.
The organizers have access to all attendee feedback channels where they can use synchronized coordinated visualizations to gather a more holistic understanding of people's perspectives. The field deployments of CommunityClick-Virtual demonstrated its efficacy in increasing participation and enabling organizers to identify insights that could help them make more informed decisions. We argue that multi-modal systems such as Communityclick-Virtual can be pertinent in enhancing participation in both professional and educational environments.",https://osf.io/szep3/,2023-09-20T15:41:58.897924,"['University of Massachusetts', 'University of Massachusetts Amherst', 'ODU', 'mjasim@cs.umass.edu', 'University of Massachusetts Amherst ', 'UC', 'asarv@cs.umass.edu', 'nmahyar@cs.umass.eduin', 'USA']",OSF

Next to its functional dimension as a sociotechnical framework, setting up a tiered participation and nested project structure, it encompasses an aesthetic dimension that holds participants and their bodies in resonance.

Without optical correction, all adults will suffer from blurry close vision starting in their 40s. In effect, different optical corrections are necessary for near and far vision. Current state-of-the-art glasses offer a gradual change of correction across the field of view for any distance—using Progressive Addition Lenses (PALs). However, an inevitable side effect of PALs is geometric distortion, which causes the swim effect, a phenomenon of unstable perception of the environment leading to discomfort for many wearers. Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between lens distortions and their perceptual effects, that is, between the complex physical distortions on the one hand and their subjective severity on the other.
We show that perceived distortion can be measured as a psychophysical scaling function using a VR experiment with accurately simulated PAL distortions. Despite the multi-dimensional space of physical distortions, the measured perception is well represented as a 1D scaling function; distortions are perceived less with negative far correction, suggesting an advantage for short-sighted people.
Beyond that, our results successfully demonstrate that psychophysical scaling with ordinal embedding methods can investigate complex perceptual phenomena like lens distortions that affect geometry, stereo, and motion perception. Our approach provides a new perspective on lens design based on modeling visual processing that could be applied beyond distortions. We anticipate that future PAL designs could be improved using our method to minimize subjectively discomforting distortions rather than merely optimizing physical parameters.",https://psyarxiv.com/pge5n/,2023-09-20T14:24:34.686158,[],OSF

This review critically analyses the sustainability claims of VF by particularly focusing on crop energy budgets and productivity. It makes evident that staple crops, vital for calorie intake, cannot be economically grown in VF. Nonetheless, leafy vegetables can and are grown in VF. Based on existing literature, we quantify VF's annual production potential and its associated electricity consumption. We use figures about electricity production to demonstrate that it is doubtful that urban VF production is more climate-smart than transport from far away. It is indeed wishful thinking that there is no environmental cost to getting rid of (free and non-polluting) sun light, even for the very best lighting fixtures. Even in a future world of green (but not unlimited) electricity, there will be a need for balancing grid usage, which does not fit well with the electricity craving of VFs. While VF significantly reduces water use and avoids chemical emissions, these benefits can also be attained in greenhouses, and they often fail to outweigh the environmental impact of electricity consumption. VF may have potential for niche crop production, or be employed for other practical reasons.

Self-control as the ability to manage desires and impulses, is a complex and remarkable construct, particularly in coping with every day challenges. The importance of self-control in regulating one’s action, emotion and cognition, has sparked interest in developing training programs. The present study adopted the Process Model of self-control to develop a video game called ""Slankers"" aimed at enhancing various aspects of self-control.
Methods
Seventy participants (aged 18-35 years) were randomly assigned to the intervention and active control groups. The intervention group received Slankers game over ten sessions for two weeks, while the active control group engaged in equal number of mathematics problem-solving sessions. Participants were assessed using the Stroop test, the Kirby delay discounting questionnaire, the Barratt impulsiveness scale, and the 36-item Tangney Self-control scale, at baseline and at the end of the interventions using the Gorilla online platform. Data were analyzed using the Python programming language.
Results
The results showed significant effects of group (F = 3.24, p &lt; 0.001), time (F = 30.09, p &lt; 0.001), and their interaction (F = 36.57, p &lt; 0.001) on the Stroop interference effect. Game training significantly improved participant’s performance in the Stroop test. Moreover, Tangney self-control score increased due to time (F = 6.14, p = 0.01) and its interaction with group (F = 9.43, p = 0.003), whereas Delay discounting decreased over time (F = 4.05, p = 0.04) for both groups. Feasibility and acceptability data demonstrate that 97.14% of participants completed all training sessions and rated the clarity of instructions as 0.95 out of 1, game attractiveness as 0.94 out of 1, and the inclination to recommend the game to peers as 0.94 out of 1. 
Conclusions
Slankers shows potential in improving various aspects of self-control. Our primary results are consistent with prior research supporting the avenue of the video game training on measures of self-control. The acceptability and feasibility findings as well as the positive effects on subjective and cognitive aspects of self-control, show promises for capitalizing on the Slankers in the future studies.",https://psyarxiv.com/xk6ca/,2023-09-20T13:25:38.531546,"['IC', 'rezapour_t@icss.ac.ir']",OSF

Additionally, we report that genetic influences play a role in individual differences in wellbeing variability in longitudinal survey data (h2=12%, 95%CI:.08, .17). In the EMA data, the variability of positive affect showed a significant heritability as well (h2=38%, 95%CI:.21, .51), whereas negative affect variability and both positive and negative affect stability was mostly influenced by the unique environment (78-100%).

Thus, identifying predictors that shape the course of post-discharge NSSI may provide insights into ways to improve clinical outcomes. Accordingly, we used machine learning to identify the strongest predictors of NSSI trajectories drawn from a comprehensive clinical assessment. Method: The study included adolescents (N=612; females n=435; 71.1%) aged 13-19-years-old (M=15.6, SD=1.4) receiving treatment from a psychiatric inpatient service. Youth were administered clinical interviews and symptom questionnaires at treatment initiation (baseline) and before termination. NSSI frequency was assessed at one-, three-, and six-month follow-ups. Latent class growth analyses were used to group adolescents based on their pattern of NSSI engagement across follow-ups. Results: Three classes were identified, reflecting: Low Stable (n=83), Moderate Fluctuating (n=260), and High Persistent (n=269). Important predictors of the High Persistent class in our regularized regression models (LASSO) included baseline psychiatric symptoms and comorbidity, past-week suicidal ideation (SI) severity, lifetime average and worst-point SI intensity, and NSSI in the past 30 days (bs=0.75-2.33). Only worst-point lifetime suicide ideation intensity was identified as a predictor of the Low Stable class (b=-8.82); no predictors of Moderate Fluctuating class were identified. Conclusion: This study identified a set of intake clinical variables that indicate which adolescents may experience persistent NSSI post-discharge. Accordingly, this may help identify the youth that may benefit from additional monitoring and support post-hospitalization.",https://psyarxiv.com/nz2ms/,2023-09-20T11:26:00.578014,"[' State', 'jeremy.stewart@queensu.ca', 'USA', 'Columbia University', 'State', 'Mason']",OSF

We found that using features generated by OpenFace provides a better solution in the case of smiles, whereas using simple end-to-end architectures proved to be much more helpful in the case of looking behavior.

Any national or global metric of mental wellbeing therefore needs to reflect not only how people are feeling, but also how well they are functioning in life across a range of cognitive, social, emotional and physical dimensions. However, existing metrics typically focus on either negative symptoms or conversely, feelings of happiness or life satisfaction, rather than functioning, or indirectly infer wellbeing from a selection of social and economic factors. Here we present the Mental Health Quotient, or MHQ, a metric of mental wellbeing that comprehensively captures both feeling and functioning, and that is based on this WHO definition. We describe the 47-item assessment and the life impact rating scale on which the MHQ metric is based, as well as the rationale behind each step of the nonlinear algorithm used to construct the MHQ metric. We then demonstrate that this results in a linear relationship between the MHQ metric and productive life function where movement on the scale from any point or in any direction relates to an equivalent shift in productive ability at the population level, a relationship that is not borne out using simple sum scores. We further show that this relationship is the same across all age groups. Finally, we demonstrate the potential for the types of insights that the MHQ metric can provide, offering examples from the Global Mind Project, an initiative that aims to track and understand our evolving mental wellbeing, and since 2020 has collected responses from over 1 million individuals across 140+ countries.",https://osf.io/d47qj/,2023-09-20T07:57:55.925265,"['State', 'jennifer@sapienlabs.orgMHQ', 'USA', ' State']",OSF

How much of that information can a reader process at once? Previous studies demonstrated that low-level visual features of multiple words are processed in parallel, but lexical attributes are processed serially, for one word at a time. This implies that an internal bottleneck lies somewhere between early visual and lexical analysis. We used a dual- task behavioral paradigm to investigate whether this bottleneck lies at the stage of letter recognition or phonological decoding. On each trial, two letter strings were flashed briefly, one above and one below fixation, and then masked. In the letter identification experiment, participants indicated whether a vowel was present in a particular letter string. In the phonological decoding experiment, participants indicated whether the letter string was pronounceable. We compared accuracy in a focused attention condition, in which participants judged only one of the two strings, with accuracy in a divided attention condition, in which participants judged both strings independently. In both experiments, the cost of dividing attention was so large that it supported a serial model: participants were able to process only one letter string per trial. Furthermore, we found a stimulus processing tradeoff that is characteristic of serial processing: when participants judged one string correctly, they were less likely to judge the other string correctly. Therefore, the bottleneck that constrains word recognition under these conditions arises at a sub-lexical level, perhaps due to a limit on the efficiency of letter recognition.",https://psyarxiv.com/f6rmp/,2023-09-20T02:44:11.281567,"['alwhite@barnard.edu', 'Columbia University']",OSF

In the current study, we compared adults’ immediate attainment and later retention of novel word meanings acquired through either direct mapping or pragmatic inference. We found that pragmatic inference facilitated the retention of novel words compared to direct mapping (Experiment 1). Moreover, better socio-cognitive skills, measured by the Mind-in-the-Eyes task, were associated with better retention specifically for meanings that were inferred but not for meanings acquired through direct mapping (Experiment 1). Furthermore, when social cognition was taxed before word learning, the advantage of pragmatic inference for meaning retention in the same paradigm was diminished (Experiment 2). In conclusion, pragmatic processes supported by social cognition affect both encoding and memory consolidation of novel word meanings.",https://psyarxiv.com/gv4an/,2023-09-20T01:11:54.382532,"['Penn', 'Northeastern University', 'University of Pennsylvania', 'CIA', 'ND', 'z.qi@northeastern.edu', 'IC', 'University of Delaware ', 'Delaware', 'USA', 'OC', 'University of Delaware']",OSF

People can employ intentional strategies to prevent conscious intrusions of negative memories, and repeated attempts to stop retrieval both reduces the frequency of intrusions and improves subsequent emotions elicited by those memories. However, it is still unknown whether memory control can improve negative emotions immediately, at the time control is attempted. It is also not clear which strategy is most beneficial for emotion regulation; clearing the mind of any thoughts of negative memories via direct suppression, or substituting memory recall with alternative thoughts. Here, we provide novel evidence that memory control immediately regulates negative emotions associated with autobiographical memories of morally wrong actions.  Repeated control significantly improved negative emotions over time, regardless of the strategy used to implement control. Thought substitution involving either positive diversionary thinking or counterfactual thinking both induced positive feelings, whereas direct suppression neutralised emotions, regardless of whether memories were positive or negative. These empirical findings have implications for clinical practice as they indicate that memory control strategies could be effective emotion regulation methods for real-world intrusive memories.",https://psyarxiv.com/v3emd/,2023-09-19T22:31:19.037578,['UK'],OSF

However, less is known about whether these models generate face representations similar to those used by humans. Sensitivity to facial configuration has long been considered a marker of human perceptual expertise for faces. We tested whether DCNNs trained for face identification ""perceive"" alterations to facial features and their configuration. We also compared the extent to which representations changed as a function of the alteration type. Facial configuration was altered by changing the distance between the eyes or the distance between the nose and mouth. Face features were altered by replacing the eyes or mouth with those of another face. Altered faces were processed by DCNNs (Ranjan et al., 2017; Szegedy et al., 2017) and the similarity of the generated representations was compared. Both DCNNs were sensitive to configural and feature changes --- with changes to configuration altering the DCNN representations more than changes to face features. To determine whether the DCNNs' greater sensitivity to configuration was due to a priori differences in the images or characteristics of the DCNN processing, we compared the representation of features and configuration between the low-level, pixel-based representation and the DCNN-generated representations. Sensitivity to face configuration increased from the pixel-level image to the DCNN encoding, whereas the sensitivity to features did not change. The enhancement of configural information may be due to the utility of configuration for discriminating among similar faces and the within-category nature of face identification training.",https://psyarxiv.com/xu4sm/,2023-09-19T20:35:33.474597,"['University of Texas', 'GU', 'The University of Texas at Dallas', 'The University of Texas', 'The U', 'University of Texas at Dallas', 'DC']",OSF

of elites and corporations buy houses as financial investments. This article thus investigates Americans’ moral beliefs on who should be able to purchase a house in the United States. Drawing on the morals and markets tradition from economic sociology and the deservingness scholarship from cultural sociology, I use an original conjoint survey experiment on a national sample of Americans (N = 1,983) to answer the question: ""What type of buyer do Americans believe is the fairest to sell a house to?"" The findings reveal a surprising divergence from market fundamentalism. Americans, regardless of political affiliation, believe it is fairer to sell to fellow citizens intending to use the home as their primary residence over the highest bidder. Open-ended responses find that concerns about investors pricing out ordinary Americans outweigh potential financial gain, highlighting buyer deservingness, previously overlooked by
sociologists, as a central component of market fairness. These results identify a stark misalignment between Americans’ moral values and the current reality of the housing market, providing theoretical and empirical insights for scholars studying morals and markets, housing, and inequality.",https://osf.io/47ux9/,2023-09-19T18:41:33.579577,"['Stanford University', ' State', 'State', 'angelahe@stanford.edu']",OSF

Yet, pathways by which discrimination-related experiences affect alcohol craving remain understudied using experimental designs. Additionally, limited research has examined possible differential effects of “major” discrimination and microaggression experiences in everyday life on alcohol craving. This between-groups experiment examined causal effects of everyday racial discrimination on stress, negative emotions, and alcohol craving. We also tested indirect pathways by which discrimination-related experiences were linked to alcohol craving via stress and negative emotions. Method: People of color and Indigenous peoples participated in the study (N=184; Mage=23.90; 47.8% women; 48.9% community adults). Participants were randomized to one of four experimental conditions, in which they experienced in virtual environments either “major” discrimination, microinsult, microinvalidation, or daily hassles unrelated to race/racism. Participants’ levels of stress, negative emotions, and alcohol craving were assessed immediately before and after experimental simulations. Results: Compared to daily hassles unrelated to race/racism, simulated racial discrimination elicited greater stress and negative emotions. Daily hassles caused greater alcohol craving among those who endorsed higher levels of coping motives for drinking. We observed minimal differences in stress and negative emotions across the three racial discrimination conditions, and found no evidence supporting indirect links between racial discrimination and alcohol craving via stress and negative emotions. Conclusion: Everyday racial discrimination—regardless of intensity level—is more stressful than daily hassles unrelated to race/racism.

both stress and sleep behaviors. Students from a public university provided continuous biometric data and answered weekly surveys for their first semester of college (N=507). Longitudinal models showed that increased average respiratory rate during sleep was associated with higher weekly perceived stress scores, effects that persisted after controlling for gender, race, first-generation status, mental health history, trauma history. Specifically, for every increased breath per minute, the odds of experiencing moderate-to-high stress were 1.25 times higher (a 25% increase), holding demographic and psychological history variables constant. Notably, relationships with stress were specific to respiratory rate, but were not found with other sleep measures previously linked to stress, such as heart rate variability, total sleep hours, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, and wake up count. Consistent with previous work, female gender, a previous mental health diagnosis, and previous exposure to multiple traumas were significantly associated with self-reported stress.

Emotions might be of particular significance in civic education, where oftentimes highly controversial and heated debates take place. We examined antecedents and effects of classroom emotions in civic education through the lens of the control-value theory, where emotions are categorized in terms of valence (positive/negative) and arousal (activating/deactivating). Specifically, we investigated the classroom climate during discussions of political and social issues as an antecedent of students’ enjoyment, shame, anxiety, and boredom, in addition to a possible mediation effect of these emotions on political knowledge and participation as core outcomes in this domain. We tested our assumptions based on data from 1,117 students at vocational schools (grades 10–13). Multilevel structural equation modeling revealed different results based on the valence of emotions, showing a positive relation between an open classroom climate and enjoyment and negative relations with anxiety and boredom. No support was provided for the relation to shame. Enjoyment related positively, and all negative emotions (shame, anxiety, boredom) negatively to achievement on the knowledge test. In terms of arousal, all activating emotions (enjoyment, shame, anxiety) related positively to intended political participation. Furthermore, enjoyment mediated the association between classroom climate and intended political participation at the student level. Thus, this study strongly supports the theoretical assumptions of the control-value theory. Pedagogically, the results imply that fostering a classroom context that is open to diverse opinions can prevent the experience of negative emotions and increase students’ experience of enjoyment.",https://psyarxiv.com/y8jpv/,2023-09-19T16:02:15.740223,"['MU', 'ND', 'UC', 'UL', 'graf.elisabeth@univie.ac.at', 'UCA', 'IC']",OSF

Background: Catastrophizing is a transdiagnostic construct that has been suggested to precipitate and maintain a multiplicity of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression, PTSD and OCD. However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms that result in catastrophizing are unknown. Relating reinforcement learning model parameters to catastrophizing may allow us to further understand the process of catastrophizing.
Objective: Using a modified four-armed bandit task, we aimed to investigate the relationship between reinforcement learning parameters and self-report catastrophizing questionnaire scores to gain a mechanistic understanding of how catastrophizing may alter learning. 
Methods: We recruited 211 participants to complete a computerised four-armed bandit task and tested the fit of six reinforcement learning models on our data, including two novel models which both incorporated a scaling factor related to a history of negative outcomes variable. We investigated the relationship between self-report catastrophizing scores and free parameters from the overall best-fitting model, along with the best-fitting model to include history, using Pearson’s correlations. Subsequently, we reassessed these relationships using multiple regression analyses to evaluate whether any observed relationships were altered when relevant IQ and mental health covariates were applied. 
Results: Model-agnostic analyses indicated there were effects of outcome history on reaction time and accuracy, and that the effects on accuracy related to catastrophizing. The overall model of best fit was the Standard Rescorla-Wagner Model and the best-fitting model to include history was a model in which learning rate was scaled by history of negative outcome. We found no effect of catastrophizing on the scaling by history of negative outcome parameter (r=0.003, p=0.679), the learning rate parameter (r=0.026, p=0.703) or the inverse temperature parameter (r=0.086, p=0.220).       
Conclusion: We were unable to relate catastrophizing to any of the reinforcement learning parameters we investigated. This implies that catastrophizing is not straightforwardly linked to any changes to learning after a series of negative outcomes are received. Future research could use further exploration of the space of models which include a history parameter.",https://psyarxiv.com/gh2fp/,2023-09-19T15:57:27.386694,"['Penn', 'UC', 'Midd', 'MIT', 'Williams', 'State', 'NU', 'SC', 'Penn State', 'OC', 'ENC', 'SU', 'ODU', 'CU', 'ND', 'SCU', 'IC', 'UT', 'ESU', 'UL', 'PTS', 'Brown', ' State', 'WC']",OSF

Although infant research has demonstrated the association between environmental experiences, cognitive outcomes, and resting-state electroencephalography (rsEEG), it remains unknown how these experiences impact neural and cognitive development throughout the school years. To address this gap, we applied a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to rsEEG data to identify which neural frequencies at rest are most strongly associated with unique aspects of socioeconomic status (SES; income and maternal education) and cognitive (vocabulary, working memory) outcomes among school-aged children (8-15 years). We find that changes in the alpha frequency are associated with SES globally, while gamma1 and theta fluctuations are tied to dissociable aspects of SES and cognitive outcomes. Specifically, changes in the gamma frequency are predictive of both maternal education and vocabulary outcome, while changes in the theta frequency are related to both income and working memory ability.

However, rewards have had inconsistent effects on people’s memory for preceding neutral experiences in experiments, raising questions as to whether our minds are equipped to remember adaptively. Here, we will use online testing in a registered report to investigate whether rewards tend to retroactively enhance certain types of memories. Consistent with prior research and theories involving how dopamine modulates the hippocampus, we hypothesize that reward retroactively enhances memory in a delay-dependent manner, emerging only after a period of consolidation. Crucially, we further predict that this long-delay modulation of memory will be stronger for associative memory than for item recognition—a factor not previously considered despite its clear theoretical grounding. This work will answer important open questions about the mechanisms by which reward retroactively enhances memory, elucidating the conditions under which this key aspect of adaptive memory emerges.",https://psyarxiv.com/hjm49/,2023-09-19T13:46:53.773663,['hrt@columbia.edu'],OSF

To understand the extent to which various demographic and social determinants predict mental wellbeing status and their relative hierarchy of predictive power in order to prioritize and develop population-based preventative approaches.
Design:
Cross-sectional analysis of survey data.
Setting:
Internet based survey from 32 countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Middle East and North Africa, Sub Saharan Africa, South Asia and Australia.
Participants:
270,000 adults aged 18-85+ who participated in the Mental Health Million project.
Primary and secondary outcome measures:
We utilized 120+ demographic and social determinants to predict the aggregate mental health score of individuals (MHQ) and determine their relative predictive influence using various types of machine learning models including random forest, gradient boosting and logistic regression. The MHQ is derived from self-ratings of 47 mental health elements spanning ten disorders and provides a score that positions individuals along a spectrum from negative to positive mental health status that aligns with life impact and function criterion.
Results:
Classification models correctly identified 80% of those with a negative MHQ, while regression models predicted the specific MHQ score within ±15% of the position on the scale. Factors with the biggest predictive impact were young age followed by frequency of social interaction with friends, frequency of good sleep and physical exercise, and number of traumatic experiences. Age had twice the predictive power of social interaction which, in turn, was twice as important as the next four most important factors. Other predictive factors included sexual abuse, cyberbullying, and use of sleeping pills and sedatives.
Conclusion:
Social determinants of traumas and adversities and lifestyle can account for 60-70% of mental health challenges. However, additional factors are at play, particularly in younger age groups that are not included in this data and need further investigation.",https://osf.io/k8h3u/,2023-09-19T12:18:19.764942,"['USA', ' State', 'jerzy@sapienlabs.org', 'jennifer@sapienlabs.org', 'State']",OSF

These measures should have high acquisition rates and good face and construct validity. Here, we investigated the feasibility of a naturalistic electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm in a low-resource context during childhood. Additionally, we examined the sensitivity of periodic and aperiodic EEG metrics to social and non-social stimuli. 
We recorded simultaneous 20-channel EEG and eye-tracking in 72 children aged 4-12 years (45 females) while they watched videos of women singing nursery rhymes and moving toys, selected to represent familiar childhood experiences. These measures were part of feasibility study that assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a follow-up data collection of the South African Safe Passage Study, which tracks environmental adversity and brain and cognitive development from before birth up until childhood. We examined whether data quantity and quality varied with child characteristics, and the sensitivity of varying EEG metrics (canonical band power in the theta and alpha band and periodic and aperiodic features of the power spectra). 
We found that children who completed the EEG and eye-tracking assessment were, in general, representative of the full cohort. Data quantity was higher in children with greater visual attention to the stimuli.

However, there is inconsistent evidence regarding whether MBPs improve work performance, and if so, whether MBPs outperform other alternative interventions. 

This randomised controlled feasibility trial assessed procedural uncertainties including recruitment and retention and aimed to estimate the likely effect size of a self-guided online MBP on work performance, relative to an alternative intervention, to inform sample size calculation for a later-stage trial. 

Two hundred and forty-one employees from 8 employers were randomised (1:1 allocation) to complete a four-week, self-guided, online delivered intervention of either the Be Mindful MBP or a light physical exercise programme (an active control intervention). The primary outcome was self-reported work performance at post-intervention measured using the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included depression, anxiety, stress, and cognitive processes hypothesised to be targeted by the MBP, including decentering and cognitive control. All outcomes were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 12-week follow-up. The trial protocol was pre-registered (NCT04631302) and published.

Eighty-seven percent of randomised participants started the course. The acceptability of both courses was high with typical retention rates for outcome measure collection (64% at post-intervention and 30% at follow-up). We found that the MBP, compared to the control, offered negligible benefits for work performance at post-intervention (d = 0.06) and 12-week follow-up (d = 0.02). We observed small effect sizes (ds = -0.09-0.04) for the difference between the MBP and the control for mental health and cognitive control secondary outcomes. Both interventions improved mental health outcomes from pre- to post-intervention (ds = -0.40-0.58, p &lt; 0.001).

Results provide little support for a later-phase trial comparing an MBP to a light exercise control. We summarise procedural challenges to inform future trials of online MBPs at work. Results suggest MBPs are unlikely to improve work performance relative to an active control. Although the MBP improved mental health outcomes, other active interventions such as light physical exercise may be just as efficacious.",https://psyarxiv.com/wamkn/,2023-09-19T11:57:11.899495,['UK'],OSF

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is the most widely used depression screener but debate still remains around its relationship to symptom experience and life impact.
Methods:
Using a sample of 5,750 respondents, we compared symptom frequency measured by PHQ-9, to ratings of life impact and the breadth of symptomatic experience measured by the Mental Health Quotient (MHQ), a transdiagnostic assessment of mental health that captures symptoms across 10 mental health disorders on a 9-point life impact scale and includes items that map to the PHQ-9.
Results:
Frequency and life impact of individual symptoms were significantly correlated. However, there was substantial variability of life impact within each frequency category, and mean life impact for the same frequency varied significantly across symptoms. In the aggregate, only 47.7% of those with PHQ-9 “severe” scores (sum score ≥20) met the most severe life impact threshold while 53.3% had average life impact ratings that aligned with a value corresponding to ‘OK’ or one point worse than ‘OK’ on the 9-point scale. Finally, individuals with “severe” depression measured by the PHQ-9 had numerous additional symptoms of high life impact, as well as highly heterogeneous life impact profiles across symptoms both assessed and not assessed by the PHQ-9 (Coefficient of variation of 119% and 122% for differences across individuals).
Conclusions:
The findings demonstrate that “severe” depression as determined by PHQ-9 frequency ratings is highly permissive in the context of functional life impact which may be a more meaningful metric for the individual. In addition, these individuals experience many and varied symptoms of equivalent or greater life impact beyond those captured by the PHQ-9 and have highly heterogeneous symptom profiles both within and beyond PHQ-9 symptoms. Consequently, those with “severe” depression as assessed by the PHQ-9 cannot be considered a symptomatically consistent or homogeneous group. Thus, assessments which capture a broader, transdiagnostic range of symptoms and their life impact could aid in more precise symptom profiling and treatment pathways.",https://osf.io/p7q8x/,2023-09-19T12:02:01.737765,"['jennifer@sapienlabs.orgPHQ', 'State', 'USA', ' State']",OSF

Using monthly protest event data and systematically coded austerity policy announcements, the study utilises an interrupted time series design to analyse austerity announcements as shocks to protest levels. The findings indicate that earlier austerity announcements significantly increased economic protest levels, while later announcements had no effect or even decreased protest. Furthermore, the impact of austerity on protest was conditioned by economic and political contexts. Austerity had a larger effect when accompanied by rising unemployment, worsening household finances, external actor involvement, and higher prior protest levels. The study contributes to understanding varied public reactions to austerity and the dynamics between economic crisis, government policies, and contentious politics.",https://osf.io/93tz4/,2023-09-19T11:29:31.995061,['chendi.wang@vu.nl'],OSF

This raises the question of whether and under what conditions austerity is an effective policy strategy to restore economic stability. This study shows that the impact of austerity on economic confidence is conditioned by an important political factor, namely the electoral strength of the government. Our macro-level time series analysis tracks the impact of austerity announcements on economic conﬁdence over time in 15 European countries during the Great Recession, showing that austerity leads to a decrease in economic confidence. However, the negative impact is substantially smaller when austerity is announced by an electorally strong government vis-à-vis a fragile one. Our individual-level survey experiment with a total of 7,500 respondents in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain indicates that the negative effects of spending cuts on both pocketbook and sociotropic concerns are particularly pronounced when austerity policies are announced by governments that are losing electoral support.

In this paper, we take a social stance on indirectness: we maintain that the choice of indirect utterances is driven by a speaker pursuing both information-driven and social goals. We define the social goals in the model via the mechanism of avoiding a conflict of beliefs in common ground. We offer a Rational Speech Act formalism and introduce the Alignment Model of Indirectness (AMI). In this model, indirectness acts as a common ground management tool that allows the speaker to probe the state of common ground before committing to particular beliefs publicly.

Simulated gambling products, like loot boxes and social casino games, contain gambling elements, but are not classified as gambling. They are available to minors, raising concerns about a “gateway effect” into gambling. This study examined the time course of young people’s engagement in simulated and monetary gambling, and associations between simulated gambling and gambling problems and harm. A necessary, although not sufficient, condition for simulated games leading to real money gambling is that simulated play must come first. 

Method
Participants were 1,026 young adults (aged 18-25 years) who played video games in the last year. They reported the age at which they first took part in seven simulated and twelve monetary gambling products, and current gambling problems and harm.

Results
First use of loot boxes and video games with gambling content tended to precede monetary gambling. Forms where gambling is a core gameplay element, such as social casino and demonstration games, tended to follow some monetary gambling forms. Engagement in most simulated gambling products was associated with greater harm from monetary gambling.

Discussion
The findings leave open the possibility of a catalyst pathway from youth engagement in loot boxes and games with gambling content to later monetary gambling, but causal psychosocial mechanisms remain unclear. However, a pathway from social casino and demonstration games to monetary gambling appears less likely, which may instead reflect containment or substitution effects.

Occupational violence (OV) towards healthcare staff often results in unrealised negative impacts on healthcare workers, patients, and the healthcare system. Hence, occupational violence prevention has become a priority in healthcare settings. Successful implementation of an occupational violence prevention program depends on the acceptability and suitability of the program to the healthcare staff. The discrete choice experiment (DCE) method has been widely used to elicit preferences for different aspects of healthcare services. The present study aims to understand the key attributes of security models of care for an occupational violence prevention program to select attributes for a future DCE survey.

Methods
A multi-stage approach was used to generate the key attributes for an occupational violence prevention program. Focus group discussions were conducted with staff at a major metropolitan hospital in Queensland, Australia, during May and June 2022, where the pilot program - an occupational violence prevention program using specialised security personnel known as Ambassador- was implemented. The identified attributes were then refined through an expert panel discussion. 

Results
Two experienced qualitative researchers facilitated four focus group discussions. The focus group participants (n=14) included the Queensland Occupational Violence Strategy Unit team members responsible for implementing the program, healthcare staff, Ambassadors, and security personnel. The expert panel, comprising occupational violence researchers, health economists, and health service researchers (n=6), refined the six potential attributes of the focus groups. The final attribute list included skills, uniform, coverage, security availability, training and being embedded in the clinical team, each with up to three levels.

Conclusion 
Attributes identified from this study will be used in future DCE studies to elicit healthcare staff preferences for occupational violence prevention programs using security models of care. The DCE study will strengthen the design and implementation of occupational violence prevention programs to best address the needs of healthcare staff.",https://osf.io/9xzmv/,2023-09-19T07:10:46.888754,"['GU', 'BW', 'r.hettiarachchi@uq.edu.au', 'The U', 'DC', 'IC', 'NU', 'BMC', 'USA', 'Duke']",OSF

This study aims to determine whether firearm owners and nonowners differ in their support for and willingness to engage in political violence and whether, among owners, support varies with type(s) of firearms owned, recency of purchase, and frequency of carrying outside the home.
Design, Setting, Participants: Cross-sectional nationally representative survey of US adults conducted May 13 to June 2, 2022 of adult members of the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, with oversamples of firearm owners and other populations of interest.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Weighted proportions endorsing violence (“physical force strong enough that it could cause pain or injury to a person”) to advance political objectives. Principal comparisons are between firearm owners and nonowners without firearms at home; secondary comparisons among owners are based on type(s) of firearm owned, recency of latest purchase (2020 or later, 2019 or earlier), and frequency of firearm carrying outside the home.
Results: The analytic sample comprised 12,851 respondents: 5820 (45.3%) firearm owners, 6132 (47.7%) nonowners without firearms at home, and 899 (7.0%) nonowners with firearms at home. After weighting, half of the respondents (51.0%, 95% CI 49.9%, 52.1%) were female; 62.6% (95% CI 61.5%, 63.8%) were white, non-Hispanic; mean (SD) age was 48.5 (18.0) years. Owners were more likely than nonowners without firearms at home to consider violence usually or always justified to advance at least 1 of 17 specific political objectives (owners: 38.8%; 95% CI, 37.3%, 40.4%; nonowners without firearms at home: 29.8%; 95% CI, 28.5%, 31.2%). For some individual objectives, nonowners without firearms at home justified violence more frequently than owners did. Owners were generally not more willing than nonowners without firearms at home to engage directly in political violence. Recent purchasers, always/nearly always carriers, and to a lesser extent owners of assault-type rifles were more supportive than other firearm owners of political violence and more willing to engage in it.

Using this approach, faces-selective saccades have been observed within 100 ms post-stimulus. When taking into account oculomotor processing, this suggests that faces can be detected in as little as 70-80 ms. It has therefore been suggested that face detection must occur during the initial feedforward sweep, since this latency leaves little time for feedback processing. In the current experiment, we tested this hypothesis using backward masking – a technique shown to primarily disrupt feedback processing while leaving feedforward activation relatively intact. Based on minimum saccadic reaction time (SRT), we found that face detection benefitted from ultra-fast, accurate saccades within 110-160 ms and that these eye movements are obtainable even under extreme masking conditions that limit perceptual awareness. However, masking did significantly increase the median SRT for faces. In the manual responses, we found remarkable detection accuracy for faces and houses, even when participants indicated having no visual experience of the test images. These results provide evidence for the view that the saccadic bias to faces is initiated by coarse information used to categorize faces in the feedforward sweep, but that, in most cases, additional processing is required to quickly reach the threshold for saccade initiation.",https://psyarxiv.com/z9tcq/,2023-09-18T21:10:11.735040,"['Boston University', 'alison.candice.campbell@gmail.com', 'jtanaka@uvic.ca', 'BC']",OSF

Yet social psychologists have typically used indicators of SES or “social rank” to proxy class. Informed by sociology and cultural psychology, we treat social classes as group contexts characterized by the interplay of material, social, and cultural capital. Subjecting three datasets to latent profile analysis (LPA; N = 30,332), we uncover qualitatively distinct class groupings within the U.S. population—each characterized by a unique pattern of capital (Studies 1–3). Consistent with theory in cultural psychology, class formation is guided by a reciprocal relationship between material capital (income and assets) and social capital (interpersonal ties). Across studies, we predict and observe one profile (the “middle/upper class”) that exhibits high material capital but low levels of social capital, and another profile (the “vulnerable workers”) that displays modest material capital but very high social capital. Studies 2 and 3 illuminate the adaptive value of vulnerable workers’ high social capital, with this group reporting similar mental and physical health outcomes to the middle/upper class (Studies 2 and 3) and leveraging their social networks to protect against health impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic (Study 3). Our work reveals that tradeoffs between material and social capital occur most reliably at the group (not individual) level; that class effects are not monotonic, but reflect higher-order interactions between forms of capital; and that LPA can be a fruitful analytic approach when combined with careful theorization, validation of profiles against appropriate covariates, and preregistration.",https://osf.io/ph3ze/,2023-09-18T20:57:39.897273,"['nfendinger@nyu.edu', 'New York University', 'State', ' State']",OSF

We analyze administrative data from the program, along with data from the census of credit transactions. Our findings reveal a substantial increase in access to credit, both in terms of the likelihood of signing a loan (extensive margin) and the loan amounts (intensive margin). These effects are most pronounced two years after land restitution, coinciding with the moment individuals gain full property rights. By delving into the specific details of these credit transactions, we ascertain that the credits obtained are primarily directed towards agricultural investments.

However, theoretical debates highlight that such behaviors could reflect a strategic attempt to manipulate others in future interactions. The personal deterrence hypothesis claims that punishment is motivated to deter future unfairness towards punishers. Here we tested this hypothesis with a total of n = 248 5-to-10-year-olds. In two experiments, participants witnessed that a divider shared resources either fairly or selfishly with a third party. Participants learned that the same divider (same divider condition) or a new divider (different divider condition) would subsequently decide how to share resources with the participant. If children’s punishment is motivated by personal deterrence, they should punish unfairness more often in the same divider condition (versus different divider). Conversely, if children fear retaliation from dividers, they should punish dividers less often in the same divider condition (versus different divider). Children intervened by taking resources away from the divider (Experiment 1) or by sending a disapproving or an approving verbal message (Experiment 2). Children were more likely to punish unfair than fair allocations through material punishment and disapproving messages, while being more likely to reward fair than unfair allocations by sending approving messages. However, children did so at the same level regardless of their future divider’s identity.

This study used an open-source Spanish-language tool called PART to test the hypothesis that a battery of assessments of auditory processing can complement standard clinical audiological assessment to better capture the variance of self-reported hearing difficulty. 
Method: Forty-three adults between 40 and 69 years of age were tested in Mexico City using a traditional clinical pure tone audiogram, cognitive screening, and a battery of PART-based auditory processing assessments including a speech-on-speech competition spatial release from masking task. Results were compared to self-reported hearing difficulty, assessed with a Spanish-language adaptation of the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly (HHIE-S). 
Results: Several measures from the PART battery exhibited stronger correlations with self-reported hearing difficulties than the pure tone audiogram.

This will make it possible to automate the distribution of victims, increase the effectiveness of psychotherapy and thus improve the mental health of the population in the conditions of war.

We consider it necessary to highlight the functional states of the anterior parts of the brain, which became the basis for the definition of neuropersonal types. According to Bohdan Tkach's concept, the functional states of neuropersonological types are continuous. Its extreme options are strengthening and weakening.

We emphasize that by the term ""enhancement"" we mean the above-normotypical course of metacognitive functions, where the idea of reinforcement is understood as the established tendency of movement towards a state of genius. At the same time, the ""weakening"" of the function of the metacognitive sphere is the lower limit of an individual's ability to be adapted in society.
Empirical research included the identification of the main targets, in particular:
- Determining the level of stress resistance
- Determination of neuropersonality types of subjects
- Determination of the level of psychological attraction to poverty

The randomized sample consists of 437 respondents, including 181 male respondents and 256 female respondents. 

The level of stress resistance and social adaptation in neuropersonality types depending on the level of psychological tendency to poverty are correlated. 

Therefore, in the conditions of war, individuals with a functional weakening of the dorsolateral part of the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex of the brain from groups with a high and above average level of psychological attraction to poverty are vulnerable to stress resistance and social maladaptation. As we can see, these persons need urgent psychological help. Accordingly, programs of psychoprophylaxis of stress, resocialization of persons with acute stress disorders and adaptation disorders should consider the specificity of these neuropersonality types.

Individuals in need of psychological help who do not need it are those who correspond to the type of functional weakening of the ventromedial part of the prefrontal cortex of the brain with a low level of psychological attraction to poverty. These individuals in the conditions of war can see new perspectives and use them to their own advantage.

Our proposed conclusions can be of fundamental importance for the organization of psychological assistance to victims of military aggression in different countries. Since it is already obvious that soon military conflicts and new fronts may probably be opened in the countries of the Arab world, Asia, the Indian and Pacific basins.",https://osf.io/b2gd3/,2023-09-18T15:12:42.076547,[],OSF

There are causes for that. Considering that such modelling always results in non-linear differential equations, not analytically solvable, this is certainly one of the causes, driving scientists to search for possible simplifications.
When technological advances gave researchers computer programs capable of numerically solving these non-linear equations, effectively removing the first cause, the same advances also produced improvements in the measurement of time and of gravitational acceleration (one of the utilities for pendulums) so that these devices have lost their usefulness as experimental instruments and consequently as subjects of interest to scientists as possible research field. There is a third cause: pendulums on Earth are always too short for the mentioned non-linearity to manifest itself, because the assumption of a constant gravitational acceleration g is sufficient to arrive to more manageable models.
This paper is a revisitation of pendulum motion analysis using Newton’s equations, not restricted to constant gravitational acceleration g. A numerical example is solved, and plotting of angles, forces and energies is presented. Furthermore, the analysis is replicated when a non-conservative effect on pendulum motion is considered, namely the air friction.",https://osf.io/h37fg/,2023-09-18T13:32:18.107087,"['giga@uol.com', 'enise.consonni@gmail.com']",OSF

Through critical textual analysis of scenes and episodes from Zoey 101, The Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Full House, and The Little Mermaid, it was clear that there are a lot of subtle messages that comment on how women’s bodies should be thin. Additionally, many shows attempt to create episodes trying to address this issue but instead perpetuate the thin ideal. Seven interviews were conducted to understand how and if these media messages had an impact on people ten to twenty years after they first viewed them.

Our findings show that while severe access barriers trigger a flight response, whereby groups suspend their lobbying activities and divert to protest actions, higher disturbances mobilize groups into a fight mode, in which organizations spend more lobbying resources and intensify different outside lobbying activities. Our study serves novel causal evidence on the important dynamic relationship between policy disturbances, political access, and lobbying strategies.",https://osf.io/fw4dc/,2023-09-18T08:56:02.083830,['Central'],OSF

The Ministry of Education has created an expert committee (le Conseil Scientifique de l’Education Nationale) which aims at: (1) compiling, synthesizing, publicising evidence on learning mechanisms; (2) building bridges between research and practice to evaluate educational practices and create practical tools for teachers. Teachers are expected to possess a strong foundation in scientific literacy, to remain perpetually informed and to meaningfully participate in research. It is unclear if and how the CSEN vision is received by teachers. 

We investigated: (1) Where French primary school teachers’ knowledge about learning comes from; (2) How they define ‘evidence-based’ education; (3) How they know that a pedagogical method ‘works’; (4) What conditions they believe are important for a successful collaboration between researchers and teachers. 

Fourteen teachers participated in semi-structured focus groups. Thematic analyses shed light on the four research questions. First, teachers were frustrated about their professional training and proactively used complementary resources. Second, although most teachers were familiar with research, several of them saw scientists as belonging to a different ‘crew’. Teachers use a diversity of methods to evaluate pedagogical practices, considering that research evidence brings legitimacy to their decisions, yet does not replace their professional intuition. Third, teachers use evaluation tools, a positive classroom climate and observations of children taking ownership of their learning as evidence of good practice. Fourth, they would like to work with scientists to identify research measures and investigate their own pedagogical research questions, building flexible and direct partnerships. Results from the focus groups are discussed with teachers to co-create a larger-scale survey and further inform local professional development offers.",https://psyarxiv.com/n9yw3/,2023-09-18T08:59:45.454303,[],OSF

(NSAIDs) in endurance sports, despite the lack of consistent evidence for their
ergogenic effects, raises questions about potential benefits beyond pain
management and the specific adverse consequences they might entail. Contrary
to the intended outcomes, NSAIDs have shown mixed effectiveness in alleviating
inflammation during or after exercise, mainly showing harmful consequences in
running. These contraproductive effects are particularly concerning for the
gastrointestinal system.
Regarding muscle adaptation, high doses of NSAIDs have been shown to inhibit
muscle growth, while moderate doses have a minor impact. Although the
available studies on the impact of NSAIDs on human mitochondrial biogenesis
are scarce, in vitro experiments suggest potential negative consequences.
Furthermore, the presumed benefits of NSAIDs in promoting healing for soft
tissue, bone injuries, and muscle damage are frequently undermined, potentially
impeding the natural recovery process. Concerns regarding bone healing
encompass delayed callus maturation, compromised mechanical strength, and an
increased fracture risk due to the inhibition of osteoblasts.
In conclusion, endurance athletes are advised to exercise caution when
contemplating the use of NSAIDs without clear indications, as their potential
adverse effects outweigh the limited advantages in terms of performance
enhancement. While short-term NSAID applications may offer transient relief,
alternative strategies should be sought for fostering long-term healing and
optimizing performance.
Considering these findings, this review aims to provide endurance athletes with
insights spanning injury management, training adaptation, race performance, and
recovery.",https://osf.io/b24nr/,2023-09-18T08:20:36.627476,['oliver.wieder@univie.ac.at'],OSF

Participants made active (self-initiated, 700 ms lower limit), quick (respond to a cue as quickly as possible) and passive (finger moved by device) button presses that triggered visual stimuli. The active and quick conditions elicited lower visual N1-P2 peak-to-peak amplitudes than the passive condition but did not significantly differ from each other. For prestimulus ERPs (lateralized/readiness potential; L/RP), all conditions showed a negative shift in RP, with lower amplitudes in the quick than in the active condition. There were no significant differences between active and passive. For the LRP, the active and quick conditions showed a sharp deflection shortly before the button press. The amplitude of both conditions was significantly lower than passive around 100 ms before the movement. Our results suggest that active and quick movements might involve similar feedback prediction, even though they are prepared differently.

Indeed, studies have shown that being more confident results in less action updating and learning, and vice versa. This coupling between action and confidence can be disrupted, as has been found in individuals with high compulsivity symptoms. Patients with Gambling Disorder (GD) have been shown to exhibit both higher confidence and deficits in learning. In this study, we tested the hypotheses that patients with GD display increased confidence, reduced action updating and lower learning rates. Additionally, we investigated whether the action-confidence coupling was distorted in patients with GD. To address this, 27 patients with GD and 30 healthy controls performed a predictive inference task designed to assess action and confidence dynamics during learning under volatility. Action-updating, confidence and their coupling were assessed and computational modeling estimated parameters for learning rates, error sensitivity, and sensitivity to environmental changes. Contrary to our expectations, results revealed no significant group differences in action updating or confidence levels. Nevertheless, GD patients exhibited a weakened coupling between confidence and action, as well as lower learning rates. This suggests that patients with GD may underutilize confidence when steering future behavioral choices. Ultimately, these findings point to a disruption of metacognitive control in GD, without a general overconfidence bias in neutral, non-incentivized volatile learning contexts.",https://psyarxiv.com/nv67e/,2023-09-18T07:32:40.740881,['m.hoven@amsterdamumc.nl'],OSF

Across all ages, children showed evidence of anticipatory control by adjusting the initial grasp to the target shelf height.

Current valve replacements, primarily mechanical and bioprosthetic valves, suffer from thrombogenicity or poor durability and do not provide growth, regeneration, and repair, features essential, especially, for pediatric and young patients. As an alternative to the currently clinically available valve substitutes, tissue-engineered heart valves hold the promise of realizing these features using bioresorbable materials that can host endogenous cells and are replaced by cell-secreted matrices in vivo over time, yielding a living valve in the patient’s heart. During nearly three decades, a variety of biomaterials and biofabrication techniques have been utilized to develop tissue-engineered heart valves. However, the quest for an ideal combination of biomaterial and biofabrication strategy to achieve longevity in these heart valve substitutes continues. Attempting to overcome various obstacles to this goal, the approach to heart valve tissue engineering has continuously evolved. Most notable examples are the application of biomechanical conditioning via dynamic cultures instead of growing valves in static condition to generate robust tissues that are capable of enduring hemodynamic loads upon implantation and more recently, implantation of acellular instead of cell-laden valves to avoid adverse in-vivo tissue remodelling. Additionally, more complex biomaterials and biofabrication technologies are currently being employed in efforts to recapitulate some of the crucial characteristics of the native valve tissue such as its microarchitecture and mechanical properties. With an emphasis on biomaterials and biofabrication technologies, this review first outlines various biomaterials used in heart valve tissue engineering and the role that material properties, such as degradation and mechanical behaviours, play in the success of the final valve product.

Over the decades, the mechanism through which particle separation occurs has been slowly understood. Particles tend to reach equilibrium positions in channeled flow under the influence of inertial forces. In the last decade, particle separation techniques based on inertial forces have been applied to cell-sorting microfluidics devices, improving throughput with simple and precise manipulation of fluid flow in point-of-care and clinical diagnostics. The designs are based on the Segre-Silberberg effect along a straight section of a channel and Dean's effect in a curvilinear channel. In this study, we focus on the study of Dean's effect, which depends on the curvilinear nature of the channel. The presence of a curvilinear channel induces rotating Dean's vortices, which lead to the separation of particles in the channel. Based on numerical simulations using a custom-designed channel, our results show Dean's vortices develop initially at a low Dean's number on the inner radius side of a curved channel near the top and bottom corners. As Dean's number increases, Dean's vortices transition to the central parts of the channel, symmetrically placed above and below the central plane. Analysis of lift forces on a small neutrally buoyant sphere in the curvilinear channel shows that the sphere tends to be focused at the central positions of the channel, consistent with the positions of the Dean's vortices present in the curvilinear channel at the corresponding Dean's number.",https://osf.io/sxz7g/,2023-09-17T22:48:12.666676,"['xiwang@s.sfusd.edu', 'San Francisco ', 'USA']",OSF

Although identical reproduction of a sound is implied to be acoustically identical, numerous fixed and variable conditions are affecting the acoustic result. To arrive at a better understanding of the causes and the extent of deviations in sound reproduction, differences in the amplitude, phase and frequency of a sound signal at various stages in the process of reproduction were measured and compared under a set of controlled conditions, one of them being the presence of a human subject in the acoustic environment. Deviations in acoustic reproduction were found to be significantly smaller than ± 0.1 dB amplitude and ± 1 degree phase shift when comparing trials recorded on the same day. Deviations significantly increased greater than 5 times the amplitude and 6 times the phase shift when comparing trials recorded on different days. Deviations further increased significantly with greater than 59 times the amplitude and 32 times the phase shift with a human subject present in the acoustic environment. For the first time, it was shown that the human body does not always absorb, but can also amplify sound energy.  The degree of either absorption or amplification per frequency shows consistent variance in response to the subject and changes in the stimulus, indicating a non-linear relationship between the observed deviations and the presence of the human subject.

According to the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) in March 2021 in Indonesia there are 27.54 million people who are below the poverty line and the benchmark for people living below the poverty line is those who have an income of Rp.472,525 per capita per month. set. In the pillars of Islam, zakat is paid and given to the group who receives it (asnaf). Zakat occupies a very important position in Islam so that it is positioned as the third pillar of Islam after prayer. Calculation of zakat and poverty rates, the number of workers who issue professional zakat can be the answer to straighten out the mistakes of people who have not received professional zakat. Professional zakat is zakat imposed on professional income if it has reached the nishab. From the verse of the Qur'an Surah Al-Baqarah verse 267: which means ""O people who believe, spend some of what we remove from the earth for you ..."" the verse describes the livelihood that is given and the nature of that livelihood. the command of the verse is obligatory, then all business results in whatever form must be paid for zakat, including the salary of an employee, if his salary has reached the conditions stipulated in the context of zakat. One of the tasks of zakat management institutions whose existence is protected by law is to realize the role of zakat as a solution to overcome poverty. Productive zakat is to increase or as business capital mustahiq. Zakat results in a redistribution of market commodities from the rich to the poor. In principle, there are two ways of distributing zakat through wealth and income. Which is a second type of distribution, especially if it is given in cash to mustahik.

Societal change is required to mitigate the negative effects of climate change, as well as help people adapt to the associated health risks. This requires situation-specific, large-scale data that can help identify the relevant areas for policymaking and communication. Such behavioral data can help scientists and policymakers understand public perceptions and behaviors, as well as identify the levers to increase public readiness to act (RTA) against climate change and protect their health. The Planetary Health Action Survey (PACE) explores RTA, integrating individual behavior, policy acceptance, and political participation as its key indicators and determinants. The survey seeks to develop and refine an integrated conceptual model of RTA, create valid corresponding measurement instruments, and implement them in monitoring. This contribution serves as the study protocol for PACE.
Methods: In cross-sectional data collections, a comprehensive set of sociocognitive factors, including climate change knowledge, trust in institutions, perceived health risks, self-efficacy, social norms, and perceived effectiveness of policy measures, are assessed. The online questionnaire is updated regularly and involves a nonprobabilistic quota sample from the German population (N ≈ 1,000 at each data collection). 
Discussion: PACE contributes to a comprehensive understanding of tackling climate change and related health risks by considering the different facets relevant to societal change. In addition, it allows for observing changes over time and adjustments to the model, as well as including current topics and debates. It provides a broad foundation for future health and crisis communication. PACE contributes to informing climate change and health communication, policymaking, and interventions by providing insights into the multidimensional factors influencing RTA against climate change.",https://psyarxiv.com/jcwv7/,2023-09-17T09:44:56.023050,['lena.lehrer@bnitm.de'],OSF

Switzerland is a case in point, where no ethnic data are collected in official data. Nevertheless, members of minority groups, such as Afro-descendants, call for such data to make their presence visible.

Necessary assumptions and limitations – both conceptually and methodologically – are discussed. Results: We estimate the number of Afro-descendants in Switzerland in 2021 to be around 230 to 240 thousand persons (around 2.6% of the resident population).

Viewed in this way, these pursuits become largely logical problems to solve—if-else rules that designate or classify the occurrence of an outcome. The challenge becomes how to build sets of necessary conditions and how to identify the sets that are sufficient for the outcome. We propose a two-stage approach in which sets of concurrent and/or sequential elements are built iteratively from singles to pairs to triples and so forth via mutual information. Sets are encoded as dichotomous variables via Boolean operators. The explanation of the response variable is optimized by one of two methods, either the minimization of the conditional entropy or the maximization of the conditional probability. Moreover, we eschew a deterministic causal approach for a stochastic framework, wherein we examine necessary and sufficient conditions for the likelihood of event above or below an arbitrary threshold of probability or entropy. Two empirical demonstrations are provided, one cross-sectional and between-persons and one from person-specific time series. We demonstrate how the treatment of compound sets as dichotomous variables effectively compresses the information about the concurrence or sequence of set elements into a binary encoding.

Based on this, we propose that though initially, participants respond to the intervention, there is a hypothesized second diminishing effect of an intervention. However, we suggest that on top, there is a third effect. Independent of the individual notification or nudge, people could build the knowledge, skills and practice needed to independently engage in the behavior themselves (schraefel and Hekler, 2020).
Using behavioral theory and inspired by prior animal computational models of behavior, we propose a dynamical computational model to allow for a separation of intervention and internalization. It is targeted towards the specific case of the HeartSteps intervention that could not explain a diminishing immediate effect of the intervention, second hypothesized effect, while a person’s overall steps remained constant, third effect (Klasnja et al., 2019). We incorporate a habituation mechanism from learning theory that can account for the immediate diminishing effect. At the same time, a reinforcement mechanism allows participants to internalize the message and engage in behavior independently. The simulation shows the importance of a participant’s responsiveness to the intervention and a sufficient recovery period after each notification. To estimate the model, we use data from the HeartSteps intervention (Klasnja et al., 2019; Liao et al., 2020), a just-in-time adaptive intervention that sent two to five walking suggestions per day. We run a Bayesian estimation with Stan in R.
Additional validation tests are needed to estimate the accuracy of the model for different individuals. It could however serve as a template for future just-in-time adaptive interventions due to its generic structure. In addition, this model is of high practical relevance as its derived dynamics can be used to improve future walking suggestions and ultimately optimize notification-based digital health interventions.",https://osf.io/6v7d5/,2023-09-16T14:14:28.422765,"['University of California', 'University of California ', 'California', 'lisa.gotzian@stud.leuphana.de', 'Cal']",OSF

Participants were recruited to engage in a decision-making task under uncertainty while exposed to both themselves and others' outcomes. The results revealed that purely presenting others' outcomes affected participants' exploration behavior significantly, with lower rewards than others leading to increased exploration of uncertainty. Additionally, subjective expectations were found to be associated with social comparison, whereby higher rewards than others and lower subjective expectations consistently increased participants' exploitation behaviors, indicating that social comparison affected individuals' adjustment of subjective expectations.

In this paper, I examine the state of Louisiana’s changing approach to managing its coastal region in order to illuminate this question. During the 20th century, coastal management displayed the dynamics that characterize regional growth machines: a coalition of economic and political elites worked to attract public funding for economic development projects, while simultaneously resisting the implementation of state and federal regulations concerning land use and natural resource extraction. The rapid industrial development and public infrastructure projects of this period helped to usher in an ongoing regional environmental crisis that involves the gradual disappearance of coastal wetlands areas, and which places ecosystems, communities, and economic infrastructure in jeopardy. More recently, the state has developed and adopted an ambitious plan for coastal environmental protection and restoration. This plan has won accolades from influential environmental organizations and has attracted the support of prominent members of the coastal science community. 
On closer inspection, it is clear that while the level of concern for coastal environments has changed over the course of these two periods, significant continuities also exist. Perhaps the most striking continuity lies in the continued role of growth machine actors – business leaders, pro-business politicians, and economic development organizations – in driving the current coastal restoration and protection agenda. The leadership role of these elite actors shapes the state’s approach to environmental restoration in significant ways: restoration plans continue to emphasize the use of public funds for infrastructure projects, while downplaying the need for new land use regulations or for other requirements that might be perceived as economically burdensome. I propose that thinking of elite growth advocacy as adaptive problem solving helps to explain both the changes and the continuities. This conceptualization provides insights into the resilience of growth machines in the face of environmental crises, including those related to climate change, while also suggesting that growth machine dynamics do not prevent (but do shape) responses to crises.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5e8pg/,2023-09-17T13:36:39.796239,"['SU', 'University of Maine', 'CU', 'michael.haedicke@maine.edu', 'University of Maine ', 'ND', 'UT', 'NU', 'AU', 'UIS', 'Drake University', 'OU']",OSF

Differences in motor function both persist across the lifespan and scale linearly with the magnitude of core ASD symptom presentation. Because motor differences may be apparent earlier than core autism features, objective, quantifiable measures of motor function may help clinicians with early detection of neurodevelopmental delays/deviance, early diagnosis of ASD, and later differential diagnosis. Moreover, nuanced motor biomarkers represent a promising approach to parse presumed mechanistic heterogeneity across the autism spectrum, particularly as it relates to guiding precision intervention. To achieve these mechanistic-science and biomarker-development goals, we propose approaches to transcend limitations we see within the corpus of autism motor research as a whole. First, we suggest more transdiagnostic research to establish the specificity of particular motor behaviors for autism (vs. other neurodevelopmental conditions that also show motor atypicalities). Relatedly, enhancing the specificity of both motor constructs and core-symptom constructs (social-communicative, restricted and repetitive behaviors/interests [RRB]) within autism sensory-motor research will be essential for parsing the heterogeneity within the autism spectrum. Finally, in order to sharpen our mechanistic understanding, we recommend experimental designs that simultaneously and competitively test multiple cognitive-motor theories of autism within frameworks of Computational Motor Control and Bayesian Inference, as this approach will aid in developing clinically meaningful objective motor biomarkers based on mechanism. Each of the cognitive-motor theories we discuss in the chapter (hypo-priors, hyper-priors, prediction, inter-sensory bias, and sensory-motor transformation) ascribes different features of autism to different mechanisms; we recognize that different mechanisms may be at play across individuals within the heterogeneous autism spectrum in a way that accounts for both motor and non-motor heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss neuroanatomical correlates that may underpin each theory proposed, providing a brain-behavioral link between the early emerging “lower-level” features of autism (i.e., motor differences and low-order RRBs) and developmentally later emerging higher-level ASD symptomology (i.e., social communication differences and high-level RRBs).",https://psyarxiv.com/hxd67/,2023-09-15T19:30:58.727054,"['Johns Hopkins University', 'Hopkins']",OSF

Prioritization from WM is sufficiently strong to direct attention towards items that are irrelevant to current search goals. These ‘incidental capture’ results have typically been observed when remembering color or shape stimuli, but, in principle, should similarly occur using other strong guiding features such as motion. However, recent work suggests that neural representations of remembered motion directions are transformed into spatial coordinates. If so, then remembered stimuli which can easily be spatially recoded (e.g., remembered motion direction) should not interfere with visual search when feature-matching distractors are present any more than interference caused by a salient distractor that does not match the contents of WM. We replicated the traditional incidental capture finding for color: distractors matching the remembered color captured attention more than feature singletons. In contrast, when participants were required to remember a motion direction, capture was equal across distractor conditions: salient distractors captured attention, but no additional capture was observed when the remembered motion direction matched the distracting motion direction. Intriguingly, responses were faster when the search target was at a location that neural studies predict would be prioritized if remembered motion was spatially recoded. Our results indicate that some features in WM are more likely to impact attentional processing than others and that this difference in attentional capture between feature dimensions may emerge due to the ability to reformat memory representations.",https://psyarxiv.com/sx6d5/,2023-09-15T19:06:37.111735,"['danielthayer@ucsb.edu', 'University of California', 'University of California ', 'California', 'tsprague@ucsb.edu', 'Cal']",OSF

The predictive coding account of delusions, which is based in cognitive neuroscience, has increasing experimental support to explain how delusions are formed and maintained. Learning is central to both predictive coding and CBTp. Each emphasizes belief updating in response to new or surprising experiences. Despite their commonalities, treatment-related changes observed with CBTp have yet to be integrated into the predictive coding framework. Here, we adumbrate how CBTp may mollify aberrant learning processes central to the predictive coding explanation of delusions. Delusions become fixed via failure of extinction learning and inappropriate reconsolidation of prior beliefs that underwrite delusions. For persecutory delusions, a strong prior belief that the world is volatile promotes this reconsolidation, as innocuous stimuli are interpreted as evidence that the environment is changing and cannot be trusted. We suggest that CBTp reduces behaviors that trigger reconsolidation of delusional priors and increase behaviors that promote the updating of new, more adaptive beliefs. Engaging alternate, non-delusional, explanations for delusional experiences boosts extinction learning. Framing CBTp in this way proffers the exciting possibility of augmenting its impact by leveraging the neural insights of predictive coding.",https://psyarxiv.com/2ab8m/,2023-09-15T18:26:58.308581,"['USA', ' State', 'Vanderbilt University', 'State', 'RU']",OSF

We hypothesize that the continuum/spectrum approach can include not only children with DLD, but also typically developing children with different timelines and patterns of language acquisition. This model can explain individual language profiles and deficits in children.
Method: We assessed language abilities in a group of Russian-speaking children with DLD aged 4-to-7 years (N=53) and their age- and gender-matched peers without speech and language diagnoses (N=53, TD). We evaluated the children’s performance at four language levels in production and comprehension domains, using 11 subtests of the standardized language assessment for Russian – RuCLAB. Using the k-means cluster method and RuCLAB scores, we obtained two clusters of children and analyzed their language performance in individual subtests.
Results: The analysis revealed that the two clusters of children both included DLD and TD participants: Group 1, with higher test scores (TD=45, DLD=24 children) and Group 2, with lower scores (TD=8, DLD=29). Children from Group 1 mostly had lower scores at one of the language levels, whereas those from Group 2 struggled at several language levels. At the same time, children with DLD from both Groups tended to be more sensitive to linguistic features like word length, noun case, sentence reversibility, type of question in discourse comprehension compared to TD children.
Conclusions: The presence of two mixed groups shows that children with diagnosed DLD could perform on par with TD children, whereas some younger TD children could perform similarly to children with DLD. Our findings support the continuum/spectrum model: linguistic skills in pre-school children are a continuum, varying from high to poor skills at all language levels in comprehension and production.

In recent years, the ‘temporal sampling’ account of dyslexia has evolved considerably, with contributions from neurogenetics and novel imaging methods resulting in a much more complex etiological view of the disorder. The original temporal sampling framework implicates disrupted neural entrainment to speech as a causal factor for atypical phonological representations. Yet, empirical findings have not provided clear evidence of a low-level etiology for this endophenotype. In contrast the neural noise hypothesis presents a theoretical view of the manifestation of dyslexia from the level of genes to behavior. However, its relative novelty (being published in 2017) means that empirical research focused on its specific predictions is sparse.

Morphological awareness, or sensitivity to the smallest units of meaning, is a language skill that facilitates fluent recognition of meaning in print. Yet despite the growing evidence that morphology is integral to literacy success, associations between morphological awareness, literacy acquisition, and brain development remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal investigation with seventy-five elementary school children, ages 5-11, who completed an auditory morphological awareness neuroimaging task at Time 1 as well as literacy assessments at both Time 1 and Time 2 (1.5 years later). Findings reveal longitudinal brain-behavior associations between morphological processing at Time 1 and reading outcomes at Time 2. First, activation in superior temporal brain regions involved in word segmentation was associated with both future reading skill and steeper reading gains over time. Second, a wider array of brain regions across the language network were associated with polymorphemic word reading as compared to broader word reading skill (reading simple and complex words). Together, these findings reinforce the importance of word segmentation skills in learning to read and highlight the importance of considering complex word reading skills in building comprehensive neurocognitive models of literacy. This study fills a gap in our knowledge of how processing meaningful units in speech may help to explain differences in children’s reading development over time and informs ongoing theoretical questions about the role of morphology in learning to read.",https://psyarxiv.com/dfam7/,2023-09-15T15:32:11.122534,"['TU', 'Michigan ', 'ND', 'IC', 'University of Michigan ', 'marksre@umich.edu', 'USA', 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 'University of Michigan', 'UD']",OSF

As the festive season is approaching with increased consumption of different types of plastic material, we concentrated our study on the amount of plastic waste generated and the method of its disposal in the town of Mangaldoi and to determine the correlation of education qualification with the method of waste disposal. 
This was a randomised, cross-sectional research. 199 citizens of Mangaldoi participated in both online and offline mode in the survey consisting of a questionnaire of appropriate questions.
We could infer from the data that the average mass of non-biodegradable items purchased is 1.06 kg/person, 55% of the people do not buy any single-use plastics and 30% of the people do not buy any multi-use plastics. People prefer buying multi-use plastics as opposed to single-use plastics in the same price range. Average money spent per family came out to be approx. 700/- in a year during decorative items in festive season. Amount of non-biodegradable waste generated gets increased in terms of weight (in Kg) and also in terms of amount spent on it, during the festive season. We could deduce that 60% of people didn’t use proper disposal system. It turns out that among the postgraduate people, 55% of them, prefer the municipality disposal system, above the average of 40%.

Lastly, (c), we fail to find differences with respect to selective realism but find that science communicators are significantly less epistemically voluntarist compared to their academic counterparts.

In this Perspective, we outline 5 major challenges in the p-factor literature, namely that it has: (1) mistakenly equated good model fit with validity; (2) sought to corroborate weak p-factor theories through underspecified construct validation efforts; (3) produced poorly replicated general factors of psychopathology; (4) violated assumptions of latent variable models; and (5) reified general factors of psychopathology as latent, causal entities, in turn neglecting alternative models that do not incorporate a p-factor and are entirely incompatible with the notion that a single dimension adequately summarizes variation in all forms of psychopathology. Each of these challenges raise questions about substantive interpretations of the p-factor (i.e., negative emotionality, thought disorder), undermining the field’s confidence that the p-factor is a real, latent entity, or that GFPs are useful summaries of psychopathology variation.

Accurately assessing it is important for prevention and treatment. Like other mental states, anxiety is often assessed on questionnaires that are comprised of multiple polytomous items. We propose a polytomous Item Response Theory (IRT) model that incorporates a specification of the mechanism behind the binning process by which individuals select the cut points that they use to map their underlying continuous state to the discrete response options. Individuals select these cut points by minimizing the expected error made in communicating their experienced mental state relative to their beliefs about a reference distribution held by the interviewer. We are thus able to disentangle the distinct process of selecting cut points to optimize expected communication, from that associated with a specific realization of a mental state. We apply the model to data collected on anxiety among 800 respondents. The results show that the proposed model fits the data better than classical IRT models which treat cut points as (homogeneous or heterogeneous) incidental parameters.

Many psychotherapies aim to help people replace maladaptive mental behaviors (such as those leading to unproductive worry) with more adaptive ones (such as those leading to active problem solving). Yet, little is known about how challenging it is to learn adaptive mental behaviors. Mental behaviors entail taking mental operations and thus may be more challenging to perform than simple motor actions. The challenge of performing mental actions may either enhance or impair learning their expected values (compared to the more standard case of learning the expected values of motor actions). In particular, greater challenge when learning is often desirable because it improves retention. Yet, it is also plausible that the necessity of carrying out mental operations interferes with learning the expected values of mental actions by impeding credit assignment: the process of updating an action’s value after reinforcement. Then, it may be more challenging not only to perform—but also to learn—the consequences of mental (vs. simple motor) behaviors. We designed a task to assess learning to take optimal mental vs. motor actions via matched probabilistic feedback. In two experiments (N=300), the majority of participants found it more difficult to learn to select optimal mental (vs. motor) actions, as evident in worse accuracy not only in a learning but also test (retention) phase. Computational modeling traced this impairment to an indicator of worse credit assignment (impaired construction and maintenance of precise expected values) when learning mental actions, which accounted for worse accuracy in both the learning and test phases. The results suggest that people tend to have particular difficulty learning adaptive mental behavior and pave the way for novel interventions to scaffold credit assignment and thereby promote adaptive thinking.",https://psyarxiv.com/agprs/,2023-09-15T13:42:33.036315,"['Brown University', 'peter.hitchcock@emory.edu', 'Emory University', 'Brown']",OSF

Based on this mathematics Einstein predicted correctly the deflection of light by the gravitational field of the sun, observed in the Eddington Experiment in 1919 during a total solar eclipse.

In theoretical physics, the problem of time is a conceptual conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics regards the flow of time as universal and absolute, whereas general relativity regards the flow of time as malleable and relative.

The theory of General Relativity correctly does not predict an increase or decrease of the speed of light within a gravitational field. Because within the (gravitational)  curvature of space and time, the  intervals for the space coordinates and time coordinate do not change. Only the direction of the beam of light has been changed, following the (by a gravitational field caused) curved space-time path. For this reason the Theory of General Relativity predicts a constant value for the frequency of the light following a curved space-time path [37], [41]. Because the time intervals and he space interval do not change within the curvature. A straight line being transformed into a circle does not get shorter or longer. Only the Lorentz time-dilation and the Lorentz space contraction have to be taken into account. The Lorentz contraction and time dilation can be neglected in the experiments for Gravitational Redshift. 

All publications related to the well observed effects of “Gravitational RedShift/ Blueshift” within a gravitational field explain this effect by the frequency shift due to the shift in potential energy within a gravitational field. The proportional relationship between (potential) energy and frequency is Planck’s law and has nothing to do with the theory of general relativity. The observed effects of Gravitational Redshift is in contradiction with the Theory of General Relativity. Because a curved space-time geometry does not change the time intervals and does not change the space intervals within a gravitational field. Only the direction of the beam of light will change and follow the curved 4-dimensional space-time geometry. A change of the magnitude of the speed of light has never been observed within gravitational fields. 

The only theory which predicts Gravitational Redshift correctly, with margins smaller than 15 digits beyond the decimal point, is the new theory presented in this article.

The “Gravitational RedShift” [2, 5] between an observatory on Earth (Radius = 6 10^6 [m]) and a Satellite in a Galileo Orbit (Radius = 23222 10^3 [m]) according “Planck’s law” (incorrectly mentioned as “General Relativity” in the publications):

0.00000000004360134475689392
  
Both values are always within the measured Gravitational RedShift in all observations being published since the first observation of the gravitational redshift in the spectral lines from the White Dwarf which was the measurement of the shift of the star Sirius B, the white dwarf companion to the star Sirius, by W.S.

Durch die Nutzung von VR-Brillen wird dabei die Illusion einer digitalen Realität erzeugt, welche entsprechend innovative Möglichkeiten zur Darstellung naturwissenschaftlicher Objekte zu Themenfeldern wie der Humanbiologie sein kann. In der vorliegenden Studie wurden daher Reaktionen ausgewählter Lernender auf ein immersives Herzmodell im Rahmen qualitativer Interviews untersucht. Dabei wurden (1) fachliche Lernprozesse auf Grundlage der Vorstellungen von Lernenden rekonstruiert, (2) der Einbindungsgrad der digitalen Medien mithilfe des SAMR Modells untersucht und (3) mögliche Vor- und Nachteile durch Lernende reflektiert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass der Einsatz von IVR fachlich adäquate Vorstellungen bei ausgewählten Lernenden fördern kann.

Despite its rele-vance, the interplay between, and dynamics of, emotions and their regulation is still little under-stood, particularly as prior research primarily relied on between-person research approaches. In the present study, we use a situated assessment approach and a novel statistical approach, dy-namic network modelling, to simultaneously analyze between-person associations, contempo-raneous within-person associations as well as temporal lagged within-person associations and stability of achievement emotions and emotion regulation strategies in multivariate models. We used a total of 6,915 assessments of 201 undergraduate students on six emotions (joy, pride, hope, satisfaction, anxiety, anger, and boredom) and eight emotion regulation strategies (activa-tion, social support, positive refocusing, rumination, reappraisal, suppression, expression, taking action) during exam preparation in two assessment waves (fives week prior, and one week prior to important exams). Our findings identified distinct communities of emotions and emotion reg-ulation strategies, wherein taking action and reappraisal held a particularly central position for explaining their linkages. We found evidence for effects from emotions on use of emotion regu-lation strategies, and vice-versa, and identified self-enforcing loops and carryover effects. We also observed differences in the stability of the assessed constructs of time, and between the week before the exam and five weeks before, that emphasize the consideration of not only per-son and specific components, but also the respective context at hand, to which end dynamic network analyses emerge as a promising research perspective.",https://psyarxiv.com/qwgaf/,2023-09-15T10:00:58.538740,"['tin.Daumiller@phil.uni', 'ND', 'TU', 'Cal', 'UND']",OSF

However, studies examining the shape and robustness of how feelings of effort map onto objective outputs are limited and report inconsistent results. To address this, we investigated whether (1) producing isometric forces according to RPE levels reliably leads to differences in force output, (2) if feelings of effort map linearly or non-linearly onto force output, and (3) if this mapping is robust when visual feedback and social facilitation are present. In a counterbalanced repeated measures design, N = 26 participants performed isometric handgrip contractions prescribed by ten levels of the Borg CR-10 scale. They did so either with or without the availability of concurrent visual feedback regarding their force production, and in the presence or absence of another person performing the same task simultaneously. We found that subjects reliably produced different force outputs that corresponded to each RPE level. Furthermore, concurrent visual feedback led to a linearization of force output, while in the absence of feedback, the produced forces could also be described by quadratic and cubic functions. Exploratory post-hoc analyses revealed that participants perceived moderate RPE levels to be more challenging to produce. By shedding light on the dynamic nature of the mapping between RPE and objective performance, our findings provide helpful insights regarding the utility of RPE scales.",https://psyarxiv.com/psvhm/,2023-09-15T09:55:06.656094,['UNI'],OSF

We present the results of a collaborative project assessing the correspondence between curiosity measures in personality psychology and cognitive science. 820 participants completed 15 personality trait measures and 9 cognitive tasks that tested multiple aspects of information demand. Shared variance across the cognitive tasks was captured by a dimension reflecting directed (uncertainty-driven) versus random (stochasticity-driven) exploration. Individual differences along this axis were significantly and consistently predicted by personality traits. However, the personality predictors were not the core elements of trait curiosity, but instead included stress tolerance, thrill seeking, extraversion, need for cognition, and behavioral inhibition.

Twelve experiments suggest these reputational concerns are systematically miscalibrated, creating a misplaced barrier to honesty in relationships. In hypothetical scenarios (Experiments 1, S1, &amp; S2), laboratory experiments (Experiments 2 &amp; 6), and field settings (Experiments 3 &amp; 4), those who imagined revealing, or who actually revealed, negative information they were keeping secret expected to be judged significantly more harshly than recipients expected to judge, or actually judged, them. We theorized that revealers’ pessimistic expectations stem not only from the cognitive accessibility of negative information (Experiment S3), but also from a perspective gap such that the negative outcomes of disclosing this information, compared to positive outcomes, are more accessible for prospective revealers than for recipients. Consistent with this mechanism, revealers’ expectations were better calibrated when directed to focus on positive thoughts, or when they considered revealing positive information (Experiments 5, 6, &amp; S4). Revealers’ miscalibrated expectations matter because they can guide decisions about whether to reveal information or conceal it as a secret (Experiment S5). As predicted, calibrating revealers’ expectations increased their willingness to reveal negative information to others (Experiment 7), suggesting that miscalibrated fears of others’ judgment create a misplaced barrier to honesty in relationships. Overestimating the reputational costs of disclosing negative information might leave people carrying a heavier burden of secrecy than would be optimal for their own wellbeing.",https://psyarxiv.com/kqc6b/,2023-09-15T01:28:54.459699,"['Penn', 'UC', 'michael.kardas@okstate.edu', 'State', 'Cal', 'Mason', 'Oklahoma State University', 'USA', 'BC', 'epley@chicagobooth.edu', 'University of Texas', 'RU', 'amit.kumar@mccombs.utexas.edu', 'University of Texas at Austin', 'University of Chicago', ' State', 'Pitt', 'Oklahoma State']",OSF

of the total entropy in a comoving \mbox{Friedmann} volume
is launched when such a global equilibrium is perturbed with
effects of attractive gravitation. It is then underlain by two
opposite time arrows definable with the respective gravitational
energies of material phases equally created in such a volume from 
vacuum decay. Due to thermodynamic equilibrium of this process, 
either of these phases arises homogeneously throughout its entire

time arrows, such matter and antimatter thereby polarize the disintegrating
vacuum phase with their independent effects of attractive gravitation and hence
separate these created phases in terms of their time arrows. For two gravitationally
independent material phases created cosmically, their macroscopic inverse of time
is equivalent to the identical change of their creation entropies with the
respective times. Driven by repulsion of the decaying vacuum phase, cosmic

The results show no differences in the more implicit level of awareness in hands, feet and whole body, while differences are apparent at a more explicit level of awareness, with higher scores for body image satisfaction for the hands than the whole body and marginally significant lower scores for feet than hands.

A lot of the recent writing has focused on concerns of causal identification (under which conditions is it, in principle, possible to recover causal effects?); in this primer, we turn to causal estimation (how do we actually turn the data into an effect estimate?) and modern approaches to it that are commonly used in epidemiology. First, we explain how causal estimands can be defined rigorously with the help of the potential outcomes framework, and we highlight four crucial assumptions necessary for causal inference to succeed (exchangeability, positivity, consistency, and non-interference). Next, we present three types of approaches to causal estimation and compare their strengths and weaknesses: propensity score methods (in which the independent variable is modeled as a function of controls), g-computation methods (in which the dependent variable is modeled as a function of both controls and the independent variable), and doubly robust estimators (which combine models for both independent and dependent variables). A companion R Notebook can be found at github.com/ArthurChatton/CausalCookbook.

Thus, we compared ratings of musical clips of varying pulse entropy in either the most common Western meter (4/4) or uncommon meters that Western listeners would be less familiar with. In three online behavioral studies (N=383), we show that 1) perceived rhythmic complexity can be manipulated orthogonally to meter, 2) moderate rhythmic complexity only evokes the greatest groove in common meters whereas more rhythmically simple music elicits the greatest groove ratings in uncommon meters, and 3) these results are unaffected by presentation context.

Participants (30 schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder [SZ]; 30 controls) completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART). Computational modeling captured subprocesses of uncertain-risk decision-making: Risk Propensity, Prior Belief of Success, Learning Rate, and Behavioral Consistency. Key factors of cognition, risk-specific processes (i.e., Perceived Risks and Expected Benefit of Risks), and non-risk specific personality traits (i.e., defeatist beliefs; hedonic tone) are examined for relationships with Risk Propensity to determine what contributes to group and individual differences in risky reward pursuit. On the BART, the SZ group exhibited lower Risk Propensity, despite higher Prior Beliefs of Success and comparable Learning Rates. In the full sample, Risk Propensity and Prior Beliefs were positively and negatively related to IQ, respectively. Linear models predicting Risk Propensity with self-reported Perceived Risks revealed interactions between group and Perceived Risk, in addition to IQ and Perceived Risk. Specifically, in both the SZ group and individuals with below median IQ, lower Perceived Risks was related to lower Risk Propensity. Thus, within these groups, lower perception of real-world financial risks was associated with less advantageous pursuit of uncertain-risk rewards on the BART. Findings may suggest decreased risk-taking on the BART in SZ reflects risk imperception: The failure to accurately perceive and leverage relevant information to guide advantageous pursuit of risky rewards.",https://psyarxiv.com/sgbr4/,2023-09-14T18:43:31.042126,"['Indiana University ', 'Rutgers University', 'eherms@iu.edu', 'Indiana University', 'Brown', 'Rutgers']",OSF

We use data from the 1981-2020 World Values Surveys to compare aggregate changes in public opinion in 8 countries. We compare the trajectories of more sensitive and less sensitive issues to see if the pattern observed in the United States is generalizable. We find common trends – like changes in attitudes towards homosexuality – across most countries, as well as context-specific patterns that follow recognizable historical processes. An important insight is that sensitive issues seem to change more through cohort replacement. In short, issues that are difficult to talk about change more privately.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4m3g9/,2023-09-14T20:09:36.019430,"[' State', 'California', 'State', 'Duke University', 'Cal', 'Duke']",OSF

Fifty-seven volunteers (20-76 years; MAge=45.67±16.38; 39 female) suffering from sleep problems were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG, n=28) or a waitlist control group (CG, n=29). During the 6-week app phase, the EG used the CBT-I-based program and a heart-rate sensor for daily sleep monitoring and -feedback, while the CG used the sleep monitoring only. Sleep was measured i) subjectively via questionnaires (Insomnia Severity Index, ISI; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), ii) objectively via ambulatory polysomnography (PSG), and iii) continuously via heart-rate sensor and sleep diaries during the app phase. Data revealed interactions for ISI (p=.003) and PSQI (p=.050), indicating training-specific improvements in EG, yet not in CG. While PSG-derived outcomes generally appear to be less training-specific, a statistical trend towards a reduction in WASO was found in EG (p=.061). Regarding changes in SOSD, results indicate improvements during app phase (EG) for SE, SOL and WASO (p’s ≤.022); for TST both groups show a SOSD reduction.

Road navigation in the United States during the technology transition to automobiles,"States are known to hold power not only through coercion, but through social discourse. Nonetheless, the author here argues that this claim is built on shaky ground. Using a counter-factual case study with an implicit comparative design, this paper asks what happens when a state chooses not to engage with social discourse, when it otherwise would be expected to do so. Are there noticeable differences in social discourse when the state does not get involved? Considering the technology transition to the automobile in the early 20th C, historical analysis shows that the outcomes of social discourse around road navigation were extremely similar in Europe, where states were heavily involved in shaping the discourse, and in the United States, where the state was absent. This strongly suggests that neither the states in Europe, nor the state in the United States, were powerful through discourse, as what could “power” possibly mean if it has no consequences under the counter-factual? It also indicates that researchers may overstate their ability to distinguish between situations where actors are powerful through social discourse, what the author calls attributable power, and situations where actors are merely involved in social discourse, but without causing discernible changes to the outcomes with their involvement, what the author calls unattributable power.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5fmzn/,2023-09-15T10:38:21.781040,"[' State', 'UC', 'UCLA', 'Brown', 'State']",OSF

Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) generates and prioritises valid, personalised outcomes, and has been used in drugs trials involving people living with dementia (PLWD) and is suitable for participants who have heterogeneous outcomes.  We used GAS in a care and support intervention trial, administrated by non-clinical facilitators and this study aims to assesses the goals set by PLWD and their family carers.
METHODS: We developed training and methodology for non-clinical facilitators to set individualised GAS goals with PLWD and family carer dyads, or family carers alone, as the primary outcome in the intervention trial, between March 2020 and May 2022. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of the goals set to explore participants’ main priorities and unmet needs, and to consider how existing GAS goal domains might be extended in a psychological and support intervention trial context. 
RESULTS: 302 participating dyads (92% of those consented) collectively set 1043 (mean 3.5, range 3-5) GAS goals. We deductively coded 719 (69%) goals into five existing GAS domains (Mood, Behaviour, Self-care, Cognition, and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL)); 324 (31%) goals, which focused on carer wellbeing, were coded into new domains: carer break, carer mood, carer behaviour and carer sleep. The most frequently set goals pertained to social support. There was little variation in types of goals set based on who set them (dyad versus family carer alone) or according to the contemporary pandemic-related restrictions.
DISCUSSION: It is feasible for people without clinical training to administer Goal Attainment Scaling to set individualised, holistic goals for PLWD and family carers in the community. GAS has potential to increase the relevance of trial outcomes for end users of new dementia interventions, including care and support interventions. This can facilitate the roll out of more personalised care.",https://psyarxiv.com/uyz5p/,2023-09-14T15:31:10.162325,"['s.zabihi@qmul.ac.uk', 'Claudia.cooper@qmul.ac.uk', 'Nova', 'n.kupeli@ucl.ac.uk', 'Kenneth.Rockwood@nshealth.ca', 'a.sommerlad@ucl.ac.uk', 'j.budgett@qmul.ac.uk']",OSF

In addition to re-evaluating the attitude towards civilian drones in general, the current study particularly examined the use case of air taxis. It was found that the attitude towards civilian drones tended to be slightly more positive than in the first study. For air taxis, attitudes were revealed to be relatively balanced, with a slight negative tendency. Moreover, extensive inferential statistical analyses showed several factors such as active experience with drones, general sensitivity to noise, and interest in environmental protection to be significantly associated with the attitudes towards civilian drones and air taxis. The application of three different prediction models revealed that a person’s attitude towards civilian drones could be predicted with up to 71% accuracy by drone-related concerns. In this context, concerns about the violation of privacy and animal welfare had the highest predictive value. In sum, the current study provides a comprehensive overview on the acceptance of civilian drones and air taxis in Germany.

Because they are prolonged and not all stages involve copresence, the continuity and consistency of evaluative processes is a central dramaturgical problem.

We marshal evidence from a comparative study on academic candidacy in two organizational settings: grantmakers, who select candidates for funding, and universities, who select candidates for professorships. Drawing on archived records produced in the context of research grant applications and professorial recruitments between 1950 and 2000, we distinguish two regimes of textual agency throughout the processes of evaluation: documents structure the process of candidate selection throughout dramaturgical stages, and they act as relays that transfer assessments of human actors across dramaturgical stages and time. In addition, by focusing on organizational access and showing how organizations make people before even hiring them, we draw attention to the emergence of a highly scripted dramatic figure in academic life: the candidate.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/acjre/,2023-09-14T20:11:33.776590,[],OSF

To investigate these interactions, we previously developed a novel experimental study paradigm and a set of computational models, including four game-theoretic models (i.e., two conventional and two behavioral game-theoretic models) and a logit model. The aim of this study is to validate both the lab study and the models with naturalistic data to understand to what extent the results that come out of the lab are comparable to real traffic data. In the experimental study, several pairs of one driver and one pedestrian interacted with each other under different kinematic conditions and at zebra crossings in a virtual environment. The naturalistic data collection was conducted at two marked crossings (normal versus zebra staggered crossing) using state-of-the-art sensors capturing road user type, trajectory, and speed over time. Overall, the results indicated there is a fine relative validity of the experimental study where road users showed similar patterns of non-verbal communication in both studies. Similar to the lab data, crossing type played a role in interaction outcomes and metrics such as pedestrian crossing speed and vehicle delay. Pedestrians crossed more often and walked faster at staggered zebra compared to normal zebra in real traffic. In both studies, vehicle delay was affected by kinematics and location. However, vehicle delay was longer in the lab compared to real traffic. Also, unlike the lab study, pedestrian approach speed was measured and found to be the predictor of their crossing speed and the delay of the drivers. Additionally, all the computational models performed close to each other and well as opposed to the lab study.

The aspect of collective bargaining, crucial in understanding the dynamics of offshoring, has often been overlooked in previous research. This journal paper aims to address this research gap by examining the impact of collective bargaining on determining equilibrium wages in the context of offshoring. Through a comprehensive analysis of three cases—Autarky, Small Country, and a two-country scenario—we explore how fluctuations in offshoring costs influence employment levels and wage rates. Additionally, we investigate the policy implications of offshoring decisions in one country and their effects on its partner country.

This article explores the intersection of these two realms, highlighting the invaluable insights and synergies they contribute within a robust educational framework. This qualitative investigation involves two experienced teachers and three Year 12 student athletes actively engaged in dialogic-based lessons. The data collection process encompasses recorded observations and interviews with the teachers and students and uses thematic analysis techniques to analyse the gathered information comprehensively. The findings reveal that dialogic teaching catalyses student engagement and growth, opens dialogues that stimulate metacognitive processes, promotes personal growth and respectful exchange of ideas, and extends the value of transferable skills beyond the court. The role of the teacher emerges as pivotal in shaping interactional behaviour and establishing an environment conducive to skill and knowledge acquisition. Through scaffolded dialogic interactions, students are guided towards critical thinking, enabling them to develop a more thorough understanding of the subject and refine their skills. The insights gained contribute to creating transformative learning experiences by promoting dialogue, resilience, and transferable skills, empowering students to excel in both badminton and their learning outcomes, preparing them for future challenges and fostering their holistic development.",https://osf.io/m6awc/,2023-09-14T10:26:11.715695,[],OSF

Central to this endeavor is the role of leadership, which intricately shapes the implementation and success of quality assurance initiatives. This paper delves into the intricate relationship between leadership and quality assurance in higher education institutions, aiming to uncover the nuanced interplay between leadership styles and quality enhancement efforts. Through a comprehensive literature review and conceptual analysis, a robust framework emerges that illustrates how diverse leadership styles—transformational, transactional, and distributed—intersect with quality assurance mechanisms, subsequently influencing educational quality. The practical implications of the framework underscore the importance of tailored leadership development programs, cultural alignment, and strategic decision-making for effective quality assurance. Furthermore, this paper sets a visionary trajectory by delineating promising avenues for future research, including empirical validation, cross-cultural comparisons, exploration of long-term effects, stakeholder engagement, and adaptation to technological advancements. By bridging theory and practice, this paper not only enriches the discourse on leadership and quality assurance but also offers a navigational guide for educators, administrators, policymakers, and researchers striving to elevate the standards of higher education.",https://osf.io/2yemh/,2023-09-14T10:19:22.666865,[],OSF

In this paper, we investigate the effects of the Reddito di Cittadinanza (RdC), the Five Stars Movement (M5S)’s flagship social policy instrument introduced in 2019, on political support for the party. 
After nearly five years in government between 2018 and 2022, the M5S saw its electoral support plunge from 32.7% to 15.4%. However, this decline was not uniform, with the M5S gaining above 30% in several areas in Southern Italy, and obtaining the relative majority of votes (around 40%) in Campania. Several commentators argued that the relatively good performance of the M5S in Southern Italy was tied to the territorial diffusion of RdC. Does this economic voting narrative hold empirically? And, if so, is the support for the M5S driven by pocketbook motivations, or rather by sociotropic considerations regarding the benefits the RdC brings to the local economy? 
We rely on the Italian National Election Studies (ITANES) post-election survey, which included a specific module on the RdC, and match it with territorial socio-economic data (e.g., employment, poverty, population size) from INPS and ISTAT. We use Linear Probability Models, socio-demographic controls, and geographical Fixed Effects. We find that, irrespective of individual status, support for the M5S is larger in regions and provinces where there are more households with at least one RdC recipient. The relationship between being a RdC recipient (or cohabiting with one) and voting for the M5S holds, at the individual level, only in the absence of contextual controls, while it is otherwise statistically non-significant. We conclude that the electoral support for the M5S in Southern Italy was driven by sociotropic economic voting rather than own-pocket motivations, and that, in the aggregate, this phenomenon might have contributed to the geographic entrenchment of the M5S in Southern Italy.

To examine which are the effective elements in multimedia inputs and identify the most effective learning condition, the present study further clarifies the “domains” in multimedia L2 vocabulary learning. Considering that the learning target (L2 vocabulary) belongs to the verbal domain, the meaningful inputs are then constructed as within-domain (L1-based), cross-domain (picture-based), and mixed-domain (L1+picture-based) conditions.

Here, we examined whether the refreshing-induced memory boost is an all-or-none or a gradual phenomenon. If the beneficial effect of refreshing on memory performance is due to the information being selected for refreshing (i.e., selection hypothesis), an all-or-none memory boost is expected to occur each time an item is selected for refreshing, with better memory performance for items that are selected more often. If, however, the beneficial effect of refreshing on memory performance is due to spending time in the focus of attention during refreshing (i.e., duration hypothesis), a gradual memory boost is expected, with the size of the memory boost being a direct function of how long the item has been the object of focused attention. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we instructed and guided the use of refreshing during retention through the presentation of cues, and varied the number of refreshing steps and their duration independently. The number of refreshing steps, but not their duration, had an effect on recall, in agreement with the selection hypothesis. However, some of the results were less robust than anticipated, casting some doubt on the notion that refreshing is one of the key maintenance mechanisms in working memory.",https://psyarxiv.com/6f4jp/,2023-09-14T11:20:35.939943,"['SC', 'CU', 'SCU', ' State', 'Evie.Vergauwe@unige.ch', 'State']",OSF

In five experiments (total N = 1344), we examined the RITE in multilingual contexts (Belgium, Spain, US, Mexico). We found that the RITE consistently emerges in the non-native language, and is as strong as the RITE in the native language (Study 1A &amp; 1B). Furthermore, we also found a ‘cross-language’ RITE: repetition increases the subjective truth of information even if the language changes between repetitions (Study 2), and this cross-language effect is as strong as the effect within the same language, be it in a non-native (Study 3A) or the native (Study 3B) language.

We test model predictions against human performance in the domain of judgment. Simulations show that the model replicates how individuals coordinate memory and rule-based strategies.

Its combination of spatial specificity and mobility makes it particularly attractive for clinical use, both at the bedside and in patients' homes. However, achieving reliable and high-quality signals in real-time fNIRS applications requires careful consideration of two crucial aspects during the preparation and execution phases. First, while fNIRS shows good spatial specificity in capturing superficial cortical brain regions, reliably and consistently targeting specific areas within this region can be challenging, especially when repeated measurements are required. In addition, the variability of cap placement can cause problems due to a lack of anatomical information. Second, minimizing noise in signals used for real-time applications is crucial to ensure that they largely reflect the true underlying brain activity. However, fNIRS signals are prone to contamination from cerebral and extracerebral systemic confounds as well as from motion artifacts. Inadequate real-time preprocessing can result in the system running on noise rather than reliable brain activity.\\
This review article aims to help advance fNIRS-based real-time applications by covering various strategies to improve spatial specificity and signal quality. For this purpose, possible optimization options are discussed, which should help to improve the planning process and the implementation of real-time studies and thus facilitate the development of future real-time applications. Based on the existing expertise of fNIRS researchers, recommendations are made that could help to improve the reliability and repeatability of these applications.",https://osf.io/9bgku/,2023-09-14T07:35:27.541277,"['BC', 'franziska.klein@offis.de']",OSF

These circumstances can give rise to instances of media capture, a mutually corrupting relationship between political actors and media organizations. However, empirical evidence substantiating such mechanisms and their consequences remains limited, particularly in the context of Western democracies. This paper investigates a recent case, in which a former Austrian chancellor allegedly colluded with a tabloid newspaper to receive better news coverage in exchange for increased ad placements by government institutions. Employing automated content analysis of political news articles from six prominent Austrian news outlets spanning 2012 to 2021 (n = 188,203), we adopt a difference-in-differences approach to scrutinize political actors’ visibility and favorability in news coverage for patterns indicative of the alleged serious breach of professional political and journalistic norms. Our findings indicate a substantial increase in the news coverage of the former Austrian chancellor within the news outlet that is alleged to have received bribes. In contrast, several other political actors did not experience similar shifts in visibility nor are similar patterns identified in other media outlets. No such effects have been found for favorability. While these findings do not purport to prove or disprove whether specific political actors or media organizations were involved in unethical or illegal activities, they shed light on potential mechanisms of media capture, highlight contemporary threats to media independence, and underscore the critical importance of safeguarding journalistic integrity and ensuring unbiased information dissemination to the public.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/m5qx4/,2023-09-15T10:26:43.937746,"['SC', 'AU', 'jakob-moritz.eberl@univie.ac.at', 'paul.balluff@univie.ac.at', 'ND', 'IC']",OSF

It incorporates four supporting Research Projects and focuses on socio-economic developments and policy settings that impact access to home ownership. 

While high house prices are often cited as the biggest challenge faced by first homebuyers, this Inquiry highlights that the problem is significantly more complex. Critically, existing policy settings are likely to have exacerbated rather than alleviated the challenge faced by first homebuyers to finance home ownership. Politically seductive measures such as first homeowner grants and tax concessions have failed to arrest declining rates of home ownership.

Those first homebuyers who have been able to buy a home have made a variety of strategy and behavioural changes, including buying more affordable attached dwellings (e.g. units and apartments) that are further away from their household’s social and economic networks, and finding other sources of financing such as from parents. 

The Inquiry makes six key recommendations:

1. Policy to assist entry to home ownership in Australia needs bigger focus on supply side measures
2. Tax-transfer reforms are required as current policy settings disadvantage aspiring first homebuyers and benefit existing home owners
3. Policy must take into account distributional consequences (that is, they may benefit or disadvantage people from certain income groups or geographical regions) and be targeted to benefit those who may not otherwise achieve owner-occupation
4. Policy measures that assist first homebuyers need to facilitate both accessibility—the down payment constraint, and affordability—the repayment constraint
5. Policy makers need to be aware of the consequences of policy settings and avoid unintended consequences when implementing measures that are ostensibly designed to assist first homebuyers
6. Housing policy ambitions need to include other tenures, such as renting and shared equity, as legitimate long-term housing outcomes.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kjf7m/,2023-09-15T10:25:24.340144,"['MIT', 'HU', 'URI']",OSF

A Political Economy of Support for the Repression of the Business Elite,"Why do autocrats financially repress some allies but not others during an economic crisis? When too many foxes are in the henhouse, an autocrat may purge his allies in bad times and shrink the winning coalition. However, it is a risky enterprise. If he targets the wrong elite, it may backfire and trigger coups and dissent. Despite the high risk, we still do not know much about precisely who autocrats are likely to sideline from the ruling coalition. I suggest that the autocrat’s business allies are a politically expedient target during economic crises because the people perceive the co-opted business elite as corrupt. Given their low public popularity, the autocrat may justifiably blame the greedy business elite for the country’s economic woes. To develop a framework for public support for repression, I focus on Turkey as a case – a highly polarized country that has experienced a protracted financial crisis. One novel contribution of this study is the use of visual conjoints. I created fake LinkedIn profiles of hypothetical businesspeople with AI-generated profile pictures and business logos. I measured people’s support for their financial repression, depending on their firm’s characteristics, sectoral affiliations, and partisan attitudes toward the government’s economic policies. The results suggest that public support for financial coercion depends on the regime’s political economy. People are more likely to condone the extra-taxation of the business elite, who owe their success to the regime and are perceived as responsible for the economic crisis. This paper contributes to a growing scholarship on micro-level determinants of autocratic purges, and its findings have broad implications for our understanding of elite defection and autocratic power-sharing arrangements.",https://osf.io/zqcyt/,2023-09-13T19:33:26.303799,"['semuhi.sinanoglu@mail.utoronto.ca', 'Carolina']",OSF

The majority of past research on AI and human decision-making has concentrated on model explainability and interpretability, with very little focus on understanding the impact of UQ on human-decision making performance. Moreover, UQ is often equated to the model’s predicted probability, hence, not carefully calibrated. In this work, we implemented instance-based UQ for three real datasets. To achieve this, we trained different AI models for classification for each dataset, and used random samples generated around the neighborhood of the given instance to create confidence intervals for UQ. The computed UQ was calibrated using a strictly proper scoring rule as a form of quality assurance for UQ. We then conducted two preregistered online behavioral experiments that compared objective human decision-making performance under different AI information conditions, including UQ. In Experiment 1 (N = 445), we compared decision-making for no AI (control), AI prediction alone, and AI prediction with a visualization of UQ. We found UQ significantly improved decision-making beyond the other two conditions. In Experiment 2 (N = 600), we focused on comparing different representations of UQ information: Point vs. distribution of uncertainty and visualization type (needle vs. dotplot). We did not find meaningful differences in decision-making performance among these different representations of UQ. Overall, our results indicate that human decision-making can be improved by providing UQ information along with AI predictions, and that this benefit generalizes across a variety of representations of UQ. Implementing instance-level UQ for AI may improve decision-making with real systems. Future work will explore additional representations and visualizations of AI UQ under different contexts to determine the best ways to provide this information to users for optimal decision-making with AI predictions.",https://psyarxiv.com/6syfv/,2023-09-13T19:12:10.538895,"['University of Texas', 'laura.m.cooper.civ@army.mil', 'jbakdash@gmail.com', 'University of Texas at Dallas', 'muratk@utdallas.edu', 'yan.zhou@utdallas.edu', 'Army']",OSF

We asked whether sociocultural biases impact pain assessment in sixty ‘perceivers’ by measuring estimated pain in response to videos of healthy ‘targets’ who experienced noxious heat. Videos were matched for pain intensity across four sociodemographic subgroups: White men, White women, Black men, and Black women targets. Perceivers attributed pain more often (β = .41, p &lt; .001) and higher intensities (β = 8.08, p &lt; .001) to White targets than Black targets. The effect on pain perception was impacted by perceived similarity (β = -2.08, p = .001) and pain intensity was associated with explicit racial bias (β = -.02, p = .006). In contrast to documented gender disparities, perceivers attributed pain more often (β = .24, p &lt; .001) and higher intensities (β = 3.23, p = .003) for women compared to men. Finally, perceivers were more accurate when evaluating White compared to Black targets (p &lt; .001), and this was driven by differences in accuracy when viewing male targets (p = .002).

Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate if and how the Maths For Life programme, a new mathematical curriculum designed to help struggling learners, influences mathematics performance in children with Down syndrome. 
Methods and Procedure: Participants included 32 individuals with Down syndrome aged 5-to-24 years (Mage = 155 months, SD = 69.6). The study had a pre-post intervention design. The intervention group (n=15) completed the Maths For Life programme (administered by parent/guardian) in addition to their normal school classroom activities and the business-as-usual control group (n=17) completed their school mathematics classes only.

The conjunction-bias between non-spatial (Color) and spatial Grouping cues over approximate number perception extends to Symmetry and Connectedness.,"Humans and animals share the cognitive ability to quickly extract approximate number information from sets. Main psychophysical models suggest that approximate numerosity relies on segmented units, which can be affected by Gestalt rules. Indeed, arrays with spatial grouping cues, such as connectedness, closure, and even symmetry, are underestimated compared to ungrouped arrays with the same low-level features. Recent evidence suggests that also non-spatial cues, such as color-similarity, trigger numerosity underestimation. However, in natural vision, several grouping cues may coexist in the same stimulus. Notably, conjunction of grouping cues (e.g., color + closure) reduces perceived numerosity following an additive rule. Here we investigated the effect of two Gestalt cues, connectedness and symmetry, over numerosity perception both in isolation and, critically, in conjunction with color. Participants performed a comparison-task between a reference and a test stimulus varying in numerosity. In Experiment 1, test stimuli contained two isolated groupings (connectedness or color-similarity), a conjunction (connectedness and color-similarity), and a neutral condition (no groupings). We found that the point of subjective equality (PSE) was higher in both isolated grouping conditions compared to the neutral condition. Importantly, in the conjunction condition, the biases from single grouping cues added linearly, resulting in a numerosity underestimation equal to the sum of the isolated biases. In Experiment 2 we found that conjunction of symmetry &amp; color followed the same rule. These findings strongly suggest that both spatial and non-spatial isolated cues affect numerosity perception. Crucially, we show that their conjunction-effect extends to Symmetry and Connectedness.",https://psyarxiv.com/e2x8c/,2023-09-13T14:29:24.003661,['andrea.adriano@hotmail.com'],OSF

However, a systematic exploration of the available publications provides at best modest evidence for this claim. The present preregistered observational study was designed to reinvestigate the postulated association by examining hand preference of visual artists who share their artistic activities as short video clips (“reels”) on the social media platform Instagram.

Also, we did not find any support for the notion that the art created by left-handed artists is of higher quality than art of right handers, as no difference in public endorsement or interest were observed (reflected by the number of likes per post or account followers).

Now, almost all students experienced online learning instead of face-to-face during the pandemic period. The students surveyed after COVID-19 are now taking face-to-face classes after a year or two of online-based learning experience. This study compares their learning outcomes to those of students who previously only had face-to-face classes. Owing to the statistical analyses, some points are clear. Final results after COVID-19 clearly show that student outcomes dropped. Attendance and quiz scores also drop slightly and lead to reduced scores in the final results. It can be inferred that students have lost their attitude to take on challenges without giving up as a whole. Moreover, report scores dropped significantly. The rate of decline is larger than attendance and quiz scores. The reports in the surveyed classes do not rely on a shallow understanding or investigation, so the decreasing may be serious. Losing opportunities to attend and participate in classes reduce self-management ability and opportunities for communication. Online classes do not provide sufficient opportunities to be exposed to different ideas, objectively reexamine their own ideas, and create new ideas of their own. These skills may have suffered serious decline. Ultimately, it all comes down to encouraging students to be spontaneous. Even if the results are not so good, teaching too much should not be a hindrance to voluntary learning. One way to solve this seems to be a flipped classroom.",https://osf.io/jqmfh/,2023-09-13T11:20:47.038108,[],OSF

myezb,['Mattia A Fritz'],"['Education', 'Instructional Media Design']",Implementation and Assessment of a Multipurpose Appraisal-Driven Emotion Awareness Tool Based on Self-Report,"In computer-mediated learning environments, especially in remote conditions, learners often lack the socio-affective cues that are usually available in face-to-face interactions. Socio-affective phenomena are known to play a prominent role at various levels of learning processes and outcomes, spanning high-order cognitive functions, motivation, sense of belonging, and quality of interaction with colleagues. Emotions, in particular, are nowadays considered dynamic and multifaceted phenomena that serve a wide range of adaptive functions. As a result, an interdisciplinary interest has recently emerged on ways by which computer-mediated learning environments may be endowed with emotional awareness, that is, information about one’s own emotions and/or the emotions of colleagues, which is instrumental to the learning task at hand. Emotion Awareness Tools are one such attempt to bestow learners with the possibility to produce and peruse emotional awareness through a dedicated interface that coexists with the overall learning environment. The thesis provides the details of the implementation and empirical assessment of an Emotion Awareness Tool with the following main characteristics. First, it is based on voluntary self-report of emotion. Second, it implements a computational structure of emotion rooted in appraisal theories of emotion, for which emotion elicitation and differentiation is a dynamic and ongoing process driven by a cognitive evaluation of the situation. Third, learners can produce and peruse emotional awareness through the tool on a moment-to-moment basis. Adopting an iterative design process, the implementation and assessment of the tool are guided by evidence gathered through empirical contributions aimed at investigating which factors – intrinsic to the tool, deriving from the interaction between learners and the tool, between learners themselves, as well as between learners and the instructional design – determine whether and how emotional awareness may be beneficial in computer-mediated learning environments. The main outcomes of the thesis are a toolbox that allows researchers and practitioners to configure an instance of the tool according to their own scientific or instructional goals, a structural causal model of the influence of emotional awareness on learning in computer-mediated environments, and methodological techniques or instruments that may be applied in similar contexts.",https://thesiscommons.org/myezb/,2023-09-13T10:52:28.195468,['RIT'],OSF

However, more recent work suggests there may also be important differences among polysemes. To explore this further, we examined semantic relatedness decisions to irregular polysemes with unconventional, unpredictable sense extensions (e.g., ‘Windows/food menu’), metonymic polysemes with conventional, predictable sense extensions (e.g., ‘fluffy/spicy rabbit’), and metaphorical polysemes with conventionalised figurative sense extensions (e.g., ‘wooden/authoritative chair’) as well as homonyms (e.g., ‘money/river bank’) and unambiguous words. Three web-based experiments manipulated the duration of the ambiguous word (200/500/800 ms) to also delineate the time-course of access to the different senses. The findings suggest that just like homonyms, the senses of irregular polysemes have separate representations that compete with each other for activation and slow semantic processing. For the other polysemes, there seems to be a single representation that acts as a gateway to the different senses (metonymic) or maps mainly onto the dominant, literal sense (metaphorical). Overall, the findings support the distinction within polysemy and help to advance or constrain existing models of semantic ambiguity.",https://psyarxiv.com/f8xys/,2023-09-13T10:35:47.490173,"['greg.maciejewski@uws.ac.uk', 'UK']",OSF

Past research has demonstrated that both carefully formed, contemplated attitudes, but also spontaneously elicited, automatic evaluations play a crucial role in guiding consumption choices. However, the accurate measurement of automatic product appraisals can be challenging because existing measures can assess automatic appraisals on single attribute dimensions only (e.g., ‘pleasant’/’unpleasant’). This limitation is critical because a) products are never unidimensional, and b) past research has demonstrated that the complex weighting of various product dimensions (e.g., price, taste, healthiness) often plays a crucial role in consumer decision making (Maehle, Iversen, Hem, &amp; Otnes, 2015). Here, we present the Implicit Attribute Classification Task (‘IMPACT’), a new measure of automatic product appraisals that, crucially, was designed specifically to reflect the multidimensionality of products by assessing automatic product appraisals of multiple product facets simultaneously. Following guidelines put forward by De Houwer et al. (2009), we thoroughly examine the IMPACT in terms of key features of automaticity. Across five experiments, we show that the appraisals measured by the IMPACT occur fast, in the absence of intention, and when cognitive resources are constraint. Collectively, our findings make a substantial contribution to research on consumer decision making by introducing the IMPACT as a sophisticated new tool that, for the first time, facilitates the assessment of automatic appraisals of multiple product facets at once.",https://psyarxiv.com/yemqt/,2023-09-13T10:57:06.455051,['Daria.Altenburg@UGent.be'],OSF

Our findings reveal that voters place more trust in their parties when they remain steadfast during negotiations.

Yang Mengkliam dirinya telah mendapatkan wahyu oleh sang guru sejati sejak tanggal 14 Februari 1932 selama tujuh bulan berturut-turut dengan cara “Shalat daim” dan kemudian di kumpulkan dalam sebuah buku yang kemudian diberi nama “Sasangka Jati” yang artinya “Petunjuk Sejati” dan telah diterjemahkan dalam Bahasa Inggris dengan judul “True Light”. Pada tangggal 1954, pangestu memiliki 4 cabang, kemudian berkembang menjadi 96 cabang di tahun 1967, berkembang lagi menjadi 197 cabang di tahun 2005, dan menjadi 203 cabang di tahun 2010. (Suciati, 2014). Pada tahun 2014 pengikut pagestu berjumlah sekitar 200.000 anggota dan tersebar di seluruh cabang-cabang di Indonesia. Hal ini bisa demikian karena peran pengusung AKK (Aliran Kepercayaan Dan Kebatinan), yang  telah  mendapatkan    legitimasi dari  pemerintah  melalui  MK  (Mahkamah konstitusi) pada tahun 2017, dengan pernyatan mereka bahwa “Aliran Kepercayaan Dan Kebatinan di Indonesia tidak dianggap, sedangkan agama impor dan resmi, seperti  Islam, Kristen, Budha, Katolik, konguchu di akui dan  di  fasilitasi di negara ini, padahal Aliran  kepercayaan  Dan  Kebatinan  yang  merupakan agama  Nenekmoyang  yang subjeknya telah eksis dari dahulu”.

In case of this contaminant present in drinking water causes ‘Blue Baby’ disease for infants, cancers, and harmful for pregnant women. So, it is very important to assess nitrate concentration for maintaining better health precaution. Nitrate concentration, dispersion and its distribution status were evaluated in Warangal District, India. The samples show that nitrate concentration in Warangal is very high in both urban and agriculture area which have maximum level of 49.5 &amp; 83.3 mg/ liter as (NO3 – N); average value of 40.3 and 69 mg/l respectively. Even though in urban area the amount of concentration is somehow low, but it also is in harmful level. Nitrate dispersion could be observable from the high standard deviations which are 7.4 for urban area and 12.065 for agriculture area, it means nitrate dispersion in agriculture area is more than urban area’s groundwater and it is clearly observed from normal distribution curves. This high spread out on nitrate concentration shows many variations of nitrate sources from many different locations that various amount of nitrate pollutions is infiltrated into groundwater.",https://osf.io/mb697/,2023-09-13T09:48:19.388071,[],OSF

In turn, this variability might impact successful exploration. To investigate this, we collected self- and other-reports of autistic traits from university students, and tested them in an exploration task in which participants could learn the hiding patterns of multiple characters. Participants could freely change what character to engage with at any moment, providing information on what they explored and when. We quantified participants’ prediction errors and learning progress (i.e., the decrease in prediction error) with a hierarchical reinforcement learning model. We found that participants with lower scores on insistence-on-sameness and general autistic traits were less persistent, primarily relying on learning progress during the initial stages of exploration. Conversely, participants with higher scores were more persistent and relied on learning progress in later phases of exploration, resulting in better performance in the task. This research advances our understanding of the interplay between autistic traits and exploration strategies, emphasizing the importance of individual traits in learning processes and highlighting the need for personalized learning approaches.",https://psyarxiv.com/jnfdw/,2023-09-13T09:39:42.473943,"['francesco.poli@donders.ru.nl', 'USA', 'UK']",OSF

Recognizing this fundamental right, ""The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act"" was enacted on April 1, 2010, to safeguard the educational rights of children aged 6 to 14. This study focuses on the implementation and awareness of these educational laws within the tea garden community of Dibrugarh District. To gather insights, we conducted surveys in six randomly selected tea gardens within the district, where we interviewed a diverse group of individuals including students, locals, members of the Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS), members of the All-Assam Tea Tribe Students Association, and teachers from state-run schools. The age range of the interviewees spanned from 6 to 57 years, and approximately 100 people were randomly interviewed from each tea garden. Our findings indicate that most children in the tea garden community have received education up to the primary level, typically until class 5, and expressed a strong desire to pursue further studies. While a handful of them managed to attend college and pursue bachelor's degrees, the majority did not have the opportunity to do so. It is worth noting that parents residing in the tea gardens were well aware of the significance of education for a better life and actively encouraged their children to pursue education to the best of their abilities. However, they lacked awareness of the specific laws and regulations about education, which resulted in missed opportunities for their children. By gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges and underlying reasons for the limited educational progress among children in the tea garden community, we are better equipped to devise and implement new laws and provisions that cater specifically to their needs. This research serves as a stepping stone towards improving educational opportunities and outcomes for the tea community, ultimately contributing to their overall development and well-being.",https://osf.io/zy72h/,2023-09-13T09:34:58.837328,[],OSF

Identification of tissue specific histological marker is warranted to improve the diagnosis. Recent genetic study in CD identified association of ankyrin-G, which is a known protein that connects membrane bound E-cadherin with β2-spectrin in epithelial cells of the duodenal tissue.
Aims: We attempted to investigate the expression differences of ankyrin-G along with associated proteins namely E-cadherin and β2-spectrin in duodenal biopsy tissue of CD subjects compared to non-CD controls. 
Methods: Duodenal (D2 biopsy) tissue was collected from a total of 83 study participants, of which 50 were CD and 33 were non-CD controls. Whole RNA was isolated from available tissues from 32 CD and 23 non-CD controls and differential mRNA expression of ankyrin-G, E-cadherin and β2-spectrin were compared using real-time PCR. Tissue sections from 18 cases and 10 controls were subjected to immunostaining using specific monoclonal antibodies against ankyrin-G, E-cadherin and β2-spectrin. Tissue immunohistochemistry were evaluated for differential expression and pattern of expression of proteins.  
Results: RT-PCR revealed significant reduced expression of ankyrin-G (FC=0.63; p=0.005) and E-cadherin (FC=0.50; p=0.01) among CD subjects compared to non-CD controls. Tissue immunohistochemistry confirmed the reduced expression of ankyrin-G and E-cadherin in CD. Differential expression is grossly limited within outer columnar epithelial cell layer.
Conclusion: Reduced expression of two key cytoskeletal proteins (ankyrin-G and E-cadherin) were observed in CD. Reduced expression of ankyrin-G was previously reported in neurological diseases, whereas E-cadherin play critical role in neurological developments. Pathogenic role of these two proteins in CD suggests shared pathological determinants of CD and neurological disorders/conditions.

Participants (N = 1,865) rated on a Likert-scale seven newly introduced messages and two existing ones (‘Take time to think’ and ‘Gamble responsibly’) using seven evaluative statements. Participants also reported their levels of problem gambling severity. For most statements in both jurisdictions, the new messages performed significantly better than the existing ones. Specifically, the new messages were deemed more attention grabbing, applicable on a personal level, helpful to gamblers, and more likely to encourage cutbacks in gambling. The message that included a specific call to action (‘What are you prepared to lose today? Set a deposit limit’) was one of the best performing messages. Interaction effects observed in relation to jurisdiction, age, gender, and problem gambling severity were generally small enough to counteract the argument that different populations might benefit from substantially different messages.

This suggests that there is an impact neglect in evaluative judgments about mitigative behaviors, whose underlying causes are not well-understood. Here, using an online survey (N=555), we show that people have a rather poor understanding of the mitigation potential of human behaviors, and both impact judgments and the likelihood of adoption of mitigative behaviors are largely influenced by emotional processes.

Successful responses to those cues resulted in monetary gains (i.e., rewards) or omissions of electrical stimulation (i.e., relief), followed by a pleasantness rating scale.

As expected, we found that for reward and relief similarly, higher magnitudes elicited more successful responses, higher pleasantness ratings, and higher skin conductance responses.

In the current study, we tested the hypotheses that students with pre-existing misconduct intentions and behaviors were: (1) more inclined to use Gen-AI for assessments; (2) more likely to have already used Gen-AI for assessments; and (3) less likely to view Gen-AI as cheating. Accordingly, we surveyed 442 undergraduates using two subscales of the academic misconduct scale to assess intentions and behaviors related to academic misconduct. Questions also addressed their intent and current use of Gen-AI for university assessments and perceptions of Gen-AI as cheating. Findings showed that students with past misconduct intentions or behaviors were 270% and 138% more likely, respectively, to consider using Gen-AI.

Given this limitation, we postulated that an artificial intelligence model could be developed to predict glioblastoma's presence based on genetic biomarkers found within blood serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Our medical literature analysis identified mutations within the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) genes as a prominent feature of glioblastoma (Yan et al., 2010). Subsequently, we leveraged the presence of mutations within IDH1 and IDH2 genes present in cerebrospinal fluid to develop an AI model using MATLAB programming language. We obtained publicly available data from the cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics on the varying mRNA expression levels of the mutated IDH1/2 and TP53 genes in each patient. These data served as the basis for training our decision tree model to predict the presence of glioblastoma. Our decision tree algorithm compared the percentages of mRNA expressed from each mutated gene, age, race, and sex to arrive at a diagnosis. Following the training of our AI model with 394 data points, we tested the results using 134 data points, achieving an accuracy rate of 97.74%. We expect that we could refine our AI model and improve its accuracy with more data points. We anticipate that by expanding the training data to include a broader range of cancer and precancer patients, we could improve our AI model's predictive capabilities. Ultimately, we believe that this technology has the potential to facilitate the early diagnosis of glioblastoma and other cancer types.",https://osf.io/ed85p/,2023-09-13T03:48:50.678756,[],OSF

Despite the real consequences of support for violence, fairly little is known about such an extremist attitude outside studies of terrorism or aggression. Using a unique survey containing many psychological, political, and social characteristics, we find that perceived victimhood, authoritarianism, populism, and white identity are the most powerful predictors of support for violence, though military service, conspiratorial thinking, anxiety, and feelings of powerlessness are also related. These patterns suggest that subjective feelings about being unjustly victimized—irrespective of the truth of the matter—and the psychological baggage that accompanies such feelings lie at the heart of support for violence. We use these results to build a profile of characteristics that explain support for violence; the predictive validity of this profile is then tested by examining its relationship with support for the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, with which it is strongly associated, even accounting for support for Donald Trump. Our findings have implications for the detection of extremist attitudes and our understanding of the non-partisan/ideological foundations of anti-social political behavior.",https://psyarxiv.com/gbvy2/,2023-09-13T03:23:51.392344,"['mtarmaly@olemiss.edu', 'amende@louisville.edu', 'University of Mississippi', 'University of Louisville', 'University of Mississippi ', ' State', 'State']",OSF

In the brain, in contrast with NV, VV resided exclusively in early and mid-level visual areas.

To understand the reasons that drive these misconceptions, this study focuses on: identifying factors that impact family decisions about (not) raising autistic children bilingually; attitudes toward bilingualism expressed by the community, doctors, family members, and teachers; sources of information about bilingualism and autism available to families.
Methods: Through a mixed-method online survey, we explored these questions in 31 UK- based bilingual families with 34 autistic children (age M = 10.6 years; SD = 7.1).
Results: The families reported choosing bilingualism for their autistic child primarily so that the child can communicate with family and community members. Attitudes toward bilingualism in their networks were predominantly positive, with a large portion of individuals not having opinions possibly due to lack of information.

This claim is used to justify numerous arts-based clinical interventions and health policies, so it deserves thorough scrutiny. Here we show that the evidence cited in favor of the efficacy of art therapy interventions is conceptually and methodologically flawed. Conceptually, experiments investigating the effects of arts-based interventions on health do not include appropriate tests nor control conditions that would allow demonstrating that the putative effects actually owe to the healing power of art: (i) they fail to define what art is, making it impossible to compare the effect of “art” and “non-art” stimuli and activities on health and wellbeing; (ii) they fail to demonstrate that “art” stimuli and activities elicit a distinct class of “art” experiences that modulate the mechanistic causes of disorders; (iii) and they fail to include causal manipulations of physiological processes believed to be mechanisms of action that could prove that art-induced processes affect the etiology of disorders. Methodologically, most studies cited as proof for the efficacy of art therapy lacked such common clinical trial procedures as defining the therapeutic agent, randomizing group assignment, controlling for patient or researcher allegiance, controlling for the effects of other concurrent interventions and medications, comparing art-based interventions to other kinds of interventions, or conducting and reporting statistical analyses appropriately.

Higher-level properties that represent the ‘meaningfulness’ of a visual stimulus to viewers best predict whether it will be remembered or forgotten across a population. Here, we hypothesize that the feelings evoked by an image, operationalized as the valence and arousal dimensions of affect, significantly contribute to the memorability of scene images. We ran two complementary experiments to investigate the influence of affect on scene memorability, in the process creating a new image set (VAMOS) of hundreds of natural scene images for which we obtained valence, arousal, and memorability scores. From our first experiment, we found memorability to be highly reliable for scene images that span a wide range of evoked arousal and valence. From our second experiment, we found that both valence and arousal are significant but weak predictors of image memorability. Scene images were most memorable if they were slightly negatively valenced and highly arousing. Images that were extremely positive or unarousing were most forgettable. Valence and arousal together accounted for only 6% of the variance in image memorability. These findings suggest that evoked affect contributes to the overall memorability of a scene image but, like other singular predictors, does not fully explain it. Instead, memorability is best explained by an assemblage of visual features that combine in perhaps unintuitive ways to predict what is likely to stick in our memory.",https://psyarxiv.com/grxdz/,2023-09-12T18:31:27.904982,"['cdw@columbia.edu', 'BC', 'Columbia University']",OSF

Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and post-GWAS analyses have shed light on the polygenic architecture of these diseases, enabling the use of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for estimating an individual's relative genetic liability for presenting with the disease. PRS can screen and stratify individuals based on their genetic risk, potentially years or even decades before the onset of clinical symptoms.

This article summarises recent findings exploring the potential impact of genetic susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases on early life outcomes.

In this cycle, measured attention, in the form of bibliometric indicators, becomes a key asset that can be converted into readership and submissions, which in turn may generate financial resources. Our paper illustrates this in the context of the Chinese publication system, where varying attention cycles coexist. In the Chinese state-run publication system, measured attention can be converted into public support, as well as increased subscription and submission revenue.

Fassung 2022) : Hydrodynamics and Dissolution - Influence of Hydrodynamics on Dissolution Rate of Poorly Soluble Drugs (rev. version 2022),"The objectives of the present study were to (1) examine both the hydrodynamics of compendial in vitro dissolution test apparatus as well as the respective in vivo gastrointestinal hydrodynamics in dogs, (2) describe the influence of hydrodynamics on the dissolution rates of poorly soluble drugs and (3) to develop a hydrodynamic based model to a priori predict dissolution rates of poorly soluble compounds. 

Hydrodynamics of compendial dissolution test apparatus (paddle and basket) were directly characterized by means of an ultrasound pulse echo method. Fluid velocities within the dissolution vessels correlated well and in a linear manner with the rotational speed (rpm) of both the paddle and basket test apparatus, respectively. Thus, based on this correlation, it was possible to calculate velocities of the dissolution media at any rotational speed. Fluid velocities were determined using the basket method to range between 0.3 and 5 cm/s (25 to 200 rpm) and for the paddle method to range between 1.8 and 37 cm/s. These fluid velocity data, determined empirically here for the first time in compendial dissolution vessels, are a prerequisite to forecast drug substance dissolution rates in vitro. In order to calculate such mass transfer rates the so called ""Kombinations-Modell"" was developed. This model is based on the convective diffusion theory by V.G. Levich. Here, we applied it on coarse and micronized felodipine powders as drug substance models as well as on oxygen as a model / vector to study hydrodynamics independent of chemical nature or state of aggregation. As a result, predicted dissolution rate data, calculated by means of the combination model, were found to correspond well with the respective dissolution rates determined by experiment. As expected, hydrodynamics did not discriminate between different states of aggregation of the two model compounds oxygen (gas) and felodipine (solid). Using the paddle method Reynolds numbers from Re=2292 to Re=31025 were calculated. In contrast, Reynolds numbers determined using the basket apparatus ranged from Re=231 to Re=4541. With respect to changes in hydrodynamic conditions particles of coarse grade felodipine were found to be more sensitive than micronized material of the same chemical species. 

A scintigraphic method was established to modulate intestinal hydrodynamics and to subsequently study gastric emptying and intestinal transit of caloric and non-caloric fluids in labradors. For orally administered solutions time needed for total gastric emptying (GE&gt;95%) was found to depend on both volume and caloric content. GE&gt;95% for 200 ml of 20 % aqueous glucose solution differed significantly (278 min.) from GE&gt;95% for the same volume of 0.9 % sodium chloride solution (97 min.). After administration of 20 % glucose solution the mean duodeno-jejunal transit rate (MTR) was determined to be 2.7 cm/min. This was significantly different from measured MTR after administration of the same volume of 0.9 % sodium chloride solution (1.1 cm/min.). However, duodeno-jejunal transit itself was found not to correlate with gastric emptying. Gastro-intestinal flow rates (= flow influenced also by gastric emptying) were determined using an aspiration method. After administration of 200 ml of 20 % glucose solution gastro-intestinal flow rates reached (short time) maxima  from 20 to 60 ml/min. (median: 8.3 ml/min.). In contrast, gastro-intestinal flow rates were found to be significantly higher following administration of 200 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride solution, exhibiting (short lasting) maxima of up to 100 ml/min. (median: 35.0 ml/min.). Luminal dissolution rate of felodipine was found to be greater following coadministration of hypertonic (!) glucose than following coadministration of 0.9 % saline. This result correlated well with an increased intestinal fluid volume (collected 76 cm distal to the pylorus) following oral administration of 20 % glucose solution.",https://osf.io/xc3nj/,2023-09-12T17:40:50.038774,[],OSF

Many adaptive behaviors that humans have evolved to be good at, such as walking, emerge during development–not according to a genetically dictated program, but through interactions between the affordances of the body, brain, and environment. We suggest emotions are the same. As developing humans acquire increasingly complex goals and learn optimal strategies for pursuing those goals, they are inevitably pulled to particular brain-body-behavior states that maximize outcomes and self-reinforce via positive feedback loops. We call these recurring, self-organized states emotions. Emotions display many of the hallmark features of self-organized attractor states, such as hysteresis (prior events influence the current state), degeneracy (many configurations of the underlying variables can produce the same global state), and stability. Because most bodily, neural, and environmental affordances are shared by all humans–we all have cardiovascular systems, cerebral cortices, and caregivers who raised us–similar emotion states emerge in all of us.

The patterns of recycled artifacts at Semizbugu suggest recycling behaviors were frequent, yet spatially distinctive due to the mobile nature of groups who encountered these deposits.

Traditional approaches used to examine these biases have measured selective attention to stimuli that represent threats, such as pictures of negative scenes, angry faces, or feared animals. Though these approaches have repeatedly yielded evidence of these effects the measurement reliability of these approaches has been poor, limiting the confidence with which hypotheses can be tested. Recent research has demonstrated that biased attention to cues signalling imminent threat can be measured with acceptable reliability, suggesting a credible avenue for investigating anxiety-linked differences in attentional processing of threat valenced information. However, the relation between this process and anxiety vulnerability has not been tested. The present study conducted three experiments that recruited participants who varied in trait and state anxiety (N = 134), social anxiety (N = 122), or spider fear (N = 131) to complete an assessment of selective attention to cues indicating the location of threat valenced stimuli. Analyses revealed each anxiety domain to be associated with attentional vigilance, or avoidance, of threat cues and the reliability of selective attention indices to be acceptable (r-split-half = .69 - .81). The findings demonstrate multiple anxiety domains are characterised by biased attentional responding to cues signalling threat and that such biases can be measured reliably. Implications for theories of anxiety-linked attention processing and further avenues for investigating the bias, and its relation to anxiety vulnerability, are discussed.",https://psyarxiv.com/yud9r/,2023-09-12T14:49:15.877134,"[' State', 'The U', 'anovic@exeter.ac.uk', 'Western', 'State']",OSF

Testing the Predictive Validity of School Performance  for Outcomes in Emerging Adulthood,"In putatively meritocratic societies, doing well at school is a pivotal precondition for accessing further and higher education, which, in turn, has pervasive, long-term influence on adulthood development. Yet, doing well in school may also predict ‘real life success’ outside formal education settings and independent of the educational qualifications that a person attains. Such predictions are likely to become salient during emerging adulthood, a life period characterised by career explorations and social-emotional adjustment. Here, we tested the predictive validity of end-of-compulsory school grades at age 16 years in a UK-representative population cohort sample of up to N = 6,488, who were born between 1994 and 1996, for a broad range of occupational, financial, and social-emotional outcomes at age 23. End-of-compulsory school performance accounted for 1% to 20% of the variance across occupational, financial, and social-emotional outcomes in emerging adulthood. Educational attainment attenuated these associations only slightly, with school grades at age 16 accounting for variance in emerging adulthood outcomes independent of later educational attainment. We found that school grades were equally predictive for boys’ and girls’ outcomes. In children from lower family socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, school grades were more predictive of their educational attainment, financial attitudes, and anxiety compared to higher SES children, with varying effect sizes (i.e., 0.3% to 4.2%). Our findings suggest that school leaving grades facilitate the successful transition from adolescence to adulthood, independent of educational attainment, and that they might enable children from low SES families to compensate for some of their background disadvantages.",https://psyarxiv.com/eb5rf/,2023-09-12T14:51:09.949410,"['alexandra.starr@york.ac.uk', 'UK', 'Brown']",OSF

Yet, there are still no well-defined expectations for how recycling affects the appearance of the archaeological record across landscapes. Using an agent-based model of recycling in surface contexts, this study looks how the archaeological record changes under different conditions of recycling frequency, occupational intensity, mobility, and artifact selection. The simulations also show that while an increased number of recycled artifacts across a landscape does indicate the occurrence of more scavenging and recycling behaviors generally, the location of large numbers of recycled artifacts is not necessarily where the scavenging itself happened. This is particularly true when mobility patterns mean each foraging group spend more time moving around the landscape. The results of the simulations also demonstrate that recycled artifacts are typically those that been exposed longer in surface contexts, confirming hypothesized relationships between recycling and exposure. In addition to these findings, the recycling simulation shows how archaeological record formation due to recycling behaviors is affected by mobility strategies and selection preferences. While only a simplified model of recycling behaviors, the results of this simulations give us insight into how to better interpret recycling behaviors from the archaeological record, specifically demonstrating the importance of contextualizing the occurrence of recycled artifacts on a wider landscape-level scale.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v4zpk/,2023-09-12T19:55:26.544093,"['New York University', 'YU', 'Midd', 'NYU', 'University of Chicago', 'UK', 'University of Utah ', 'University of Utah', 'USA', 'Western', 'Central']",OSF

Evidence suggests tasks like childcare and domestic work fell disproportionately on mothers during the pandemic, with consequences for their wellbeing. We explore how the pandemic affected emotional and practical support available to mothers between March and August 2020 and whether changes in support are associated with changes in their paid work and mental health. Data were collected in August 2020 from 1528 UK and US mothers with at least one child under 5-years using a cross-sectional survey and are analysed using regression models. Women’s in-person contact with support networks decreased, while virtual interactions increased. Most mothers experienced a ‘nuclearization’ of in-person support: childcare from fathers and siblings increased or remained constant but decreased from the grandparental generation. Women receiving less support during the pandemic had higher odds of reducing participation in paid work. Associations between support and mental health are limited. We also identify women who concurrently experienced reduced support and increased need for help, representing a particularly vulnerable group. The nuclearization of maternal social networks likely increased physical and emotional pressures on the immediate family, risking parental burnout and affecting reductions in female participation in paid labour. There is a need for reliable and affordable childcare options that help reduce women’s burden of unpaid care labour, allowing them to re-enter (or remain in) paid labour.",https://osf.io/ne2kv/,2023-09-12T11:11:10.364833,"['SU', 'Williams', 'State', 'Cal', 'UK', 'BMC', 'USA', 'Brown', 'UP', ' State']",OSF

Accordingly, transgender youth have relatively low care satisfaction and high treatment drop-out, further exacerbating extant mental health inequities. To reduce these inequities, mental health providers need knowledge and skills to enhance transgender youth’s treatment engagement and benefits. However, a comprehensive set of practices addressing the needs of transgender youth patients and their providers does not exist. Thus, the current study developed the Gender Affirming Psychotherapy (GAP) intervention.
Methods: GAP was developed using human-centered design, a methodological approach for creating interventions that prioritizes the needs of key stakeholders, which in this study included mental health providers, transgender youth, and their parents. A scoping review of the literature and stakeholder focus groups were conducted to identify GAP, which encompasses core principles and skills to enhance mental health services for transgender youth.
Results: GAP encompasses 26 principles and 39 skills, organized within 10 domains. All principles and skills were designed to be relevant for various provider types (e.g., psychiatrists, social workers) and to be flexibly adapted to meet diverse patient needs.
Conclusions: GAP offers a scalable and flexible approach to addressing the growing mental healthcare needs of transgender youth. This study also suggests that human-centered design is a feasible and efficient method for developing interventions to address health inequities.",https://osf.io/8r95h/,2023-09-12T10:54:24.880170,"['University of Washington', 'Boston College', 'Yale University', 'ND']",OSF

To improve translation, it is crucial to ensure the quality and reproducibility of foundational evidence generated from laboratory models. Systematic reviews play a key role in providing an unbiased overview of the evidence, assessing rigor and reporting, and identifying factors that influence reproducibility. However, the sheer pace of evidence generation is prohibitive to evidence synthesis and assessment. To address these challenges, we have developed AD-SOLES, an integrated workflow of automated tools that collect, curate, and visualise the totality of evidence from in vivo experiments. AD-SOLES is a publicly accessible interactive dashboard aiming to surface and expose data from in vivo experiments. It summarises the latest evidence, tracks reporting quality and transparency, and allows research users to easily locate evidence relevant to their specific research question.
Using automated screening methodologies within AD-SOLES, systematic reviews can begin at an accelerated starting point compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, through text-mining approaches within the full-text of publications, users can identify research of interest using specific models, outcomes, or interventions without relying on details in the title and/or abstract. By automating the collection, curation, and visualisation of evidence from in vivo experiments, AD-SOLES addresses the challenges posed by the rapid pace of evidence generation.

By considering connections between entities in a graph, GNNs are able to extract valuable insights. One notable variation of GNN is the graph attention network (GAT), which employs the attention mechanism and has demonstrated promising performance in various applications. However, its ability to incorporate feature information from nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood is limited, leading to degraded performance on heterophilic data. To address this limitation, this thesis proposes a novel attention-based model, namely the Directional Graph Attention Network (DGAT). This model combines the feature-based attention with the global directional information extracted from the graph topology, as inspired by the Directional Graph Network (DGN). A new class of Laplacian matrices is proposed and an existing theoretical result on DGN is extended. This extension bridges a gap in the literature. The experimental results presented in the thesis, based on nine real-world benchmarks and ten synthetic data sets, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DGAT model compared to the GAT baseline model. Particularly on heterophilic data sets, DGAT showed a notable average increase of approximately 35% in node classification tasks across all heterophilic real-world data sets. In addition, DGAT outperforms GAT by an average margin of around 51% in all ten synthetic data sets with various levels of heterophily.",https://thesiscommons.org/fvnh6/,2023-09-12T04:14:37.448602,[],OSF

Moreover, it highlights the potential of artificial intelligence and machine learning in revolutionizing healthcare scheduling. Appointment scheduling is a common and important task in many domains, such as education, healthcare, business, and social networking. It involves organizing and optimizing the allocation of time slots for multiple individuals, taking into account various constraints such as availability, preferences, and dependencies. For example, a doctor may need to schedule appointments for patients based on their urgency, availability, and medical history; a teacher may need to schedule exams for students based on their academic performance, preferences, and deadlines; a manager may need to schedule meetings for employees based on their roles, projects, and availability.
Computational methods that can automate and improve this process are called appointment scheduling algorithms.

Network analysis aims to identify links between symptoms that may serve to maintain one other; the current study uses network analysis to identify relationships between posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms as they unfold over time within individuals. We also examine whether positive affect (PA) may buffer subsequent PTSD symptoms in daily life and compare single individual networks to the average within-person effects. 
Method. Fifty-two individuals (76.9% female; 84.6% white) who had experienced a Criterion A trauma participated in the two-week study and reported their PA and PTSD symptom levels five times a day at two-hour intervals (M surveys completed = 60.4). Multi-level and regularized individual-only network models were generated using vector autoregression. 
Results.  Feeling distant from others was the PTSD symptom most closely connected to lower positive affect; it was also the most connected to other PTSD symptoms. PA items did not predict lower PTSD at the next time point, except for one bidirectional relationship. Feeling on edge was the symptom with the largest magnitude of relationships to other symptoms in the multilevel network, but this was only reflected in 38.5% of the individual networks. Three example individual networks are described and discussed for clinical implications. 
Conclusions.  We did not find evidence to support the hypothesis that PA buffers PTSD symptom severity on the time scale assessed (2 hours).

Here, we examined whether gentle manual stroking delivered in velocities known to optimally activate the CT system (defined as ‘tactile emoticons’), during lab-simulated social media communications could convey increased feelings of social support and other prosocial intentions compared to (1) either stroking touch at CT sub-optimal velocities, or (2) standard visual emoticons. Participants (N = 36) felt more social support with CT-optimal compared to sub-optimal velocities, or visual emoticons. In a second, preregistered study (N = 52), we investigated whether combining visual emoticons with tactile emoticons, this time delivered at CT-optimal velocities by a soft robotic device, could enhance the perception of prosocial intentions and affect participants’ physiological measures (e.g., skin conductance rate) in comparison to visual emoticons alone. Visuotactile emoticons conveyed more social intent overall and in anxious participants affected physiological measures more than visual emoticons.

In the present research, we provide evidence for a novel account of the social function such metaethical judgements play in expressing tolerance or intolerance of disagreement. We propose that, in virtue of this, taking metaethical stances has distinct reputational implications in different contexts where the social implications of signaling tolerance or intolerance differ. Our account provides a more cohesive and unified explanation of existing findings than previous accounts. In Study 1, we find that, compared to objectivists, relativists are perceived as more tolerant, empathic, to have superior moral character, and to be more desirable as social partners. In Study 2, we replicate these findings with a within-participants design and also show that, despite these reputational costs, objectivists are perceived as more morally serious. In Study 3, using a novel pretested database of moral issues, we examine evaluations of people who expressed objectivism or relativism concerning concrete moral issues, in situations where the person either agreed or disagreed with the counterpart’s views about these issues. This study replicated our prior results and demonstrated that the effects sometimes differed substantially across conditions of agreement and disagreement and across different moral issues.

Category feedback, however, is often non-deterministic (e.g., by 25% chance untrue a.k.a. probabilistic feedback) rendering experiences as somewhat unreliable. In probability learning and economic decisions (when humans try to predict which of two outcomes is more rewarding), it is often observed that humans decide non-rational (probability matching, Gamblers Fallacy). Despite shared origins, the research areas of category learning, probability learning, conditioning and economic decisions (experience based) did not arrive at a consensus of what drives such probability matching strategies. Here, we offer a domain-general integrative model that predicts the mixture of behavioral trends when participants learn probabilistic stimulus-outcome regularities. We use the Category Abstraction Learning framework (CAL), implementing the hypothesis, that humans count the streak of events, and generate simple rules and conditional hypotheses with them. We present simulations of four studies, one from each domain, showing that CAL’s learning mechanisms accurately predict systematic and individual differences in category (correlation) learning, reward learning, risky gambles, and fear conditioning, concerning the phenomena of Gamblers Fallacy, positive and negative recency, or win-stay-lose-shift strategies, in a single model. One central novel CAL hypothesis to link learning phenomena under gains, losses and neutral feedback, is that gains and losses differently affect cognitive control during learning (corrective feedback processing), thereby also providing a novel perspective on risk-preferences in experience-based risky gambles. We discuss CAL’s potential as a domain-general account of human learning in experience-based decisions in light of a broader range of theories from multiple domains.",https://psyarxiv.com/h4nu6/,2023-09-11T16:06:54.234157,"['IU', 'NIU', 'r.schlegelmilch@uni-bremen.de', 'ND']",OSF

Previous brain imaging studies investigating the mechanisms underlying freezing were restricted to scan people in supine positions and yielded conflicting theories regarding the role of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and other cortical regions. We used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), to investigate cortical hemodynamics related to freezing in freely moving people. 
METHODS: We measured fNIRS activity over multiple motor-related cortical areas in 23 persons with Parkinson’s disease who experienced daily freezing (“freezers”) and 22 age-matched controls during freezing-provoking tasks including turning and doorway passing, voluntary stops, and actual freezing. Crucially, we corrected fNIRS signals for confounds of walking. We first compared cortical activity between freezers and controls during voluntary stops and during freezing-provoking tasks without freezing. Secondly, within the freezers, we compared cortical activity between freezing, stopping, and freezing-provoking tasks without freezing. 
RESULTS: Here, we provide new evidence suggesting that freezing results from an oversensitivity to stopping signals and a disbalance between the SMA and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), areas known for their role in inhibiting actions. First, we show that freezing-provoking tasks (without freezing) resemble cortical activity during stopping in both groups, with the freezers displaying higher activity in the SMA and premotor cortex than controls during freezing-provoking tasks.  Secondly, we show that, during actual freezing events, activity in the PFC was lower than during voluntary stopping.
CONCLUSION: We extend upon the current role of the SMA in freezing pathophysiology by postulating that freezing results from a paroxysmal imbalance between the SMA and the PFC within the stopping network.",https://osf.io/uvazs/,2023-09-11T15:27:47.759641,['helena.cockx@radboudumc.nl'],OSF

It extends previous research on hidden and clandestine movements beyond a focus on those defined by extremist political ideologies, violence, revolutions, and wartime resistance, to include others based on stigmatized social identities and beliefs. Specifically, I draw on a ten-year qualitative case study from 2009 to 2019, consisting of sixty in-depth interviews and ethnographic observations of over 150 LGBT U.S. military service members who were secretly involved in some form of hidden mobilization in the repeal of various policies meant to exclude LGBT persons from openly serving in the military.

In a study with a longitudinal design, we demonstrated the test-retest reliability of the VoPE scale and its ability to forecast physical activity and exercise behavior. Finally, psychometric network analysis and elastic net regression indicated that the VoPE scale covers a unique content area and makes novel contributions to the prediction of sports behavior. Taken together, the present research yields robust empirical evidence for the idea that people value physical effort to varying degrees.

A comparison of predictive and category learning and the influence of response format and framing,"When studying psychological phenomena, theories are desirable that can explain these phenomena in different tasks or contexts. However in practice, theory development often proceeds in task-specific procedures, raising questions of generality. One such phenomenon, relevant to a variety of learning tasks, is stimulus generalization. Here, we compare generalization gradients often taken to betray cognitive processes of learning, and test how much they depend on how they are assessed. We compared generalization following predictive and category learning, while manipulating two features of the testing procedure that commonly differ between domains (test framing and test format). First, participants learned how to discriminate two continuous stimuli in two outcomes (categorization A vs. B or outcome prediction A vs. No A). During generalization test, we either presented repeated decisions or probability ratings (test format) for the whole range of stimuli. Further, we either framed the task as relative competition between both response alternatives or as absolute estimate on a single-outcome (test framing). The results suggest that both test factors influence the shape of the generalization gradients in both domains. Framing seemed to influence response rules, while response format affected response determinism. We argue that the same learning mechanisms underlie category learning and predictive learning, and discuss how taking the methods of testing generalization into account can help arriving at a general theory of human learning.",https://psyarxiv.com/eakwz/,2023-09-11T12:19:11.386462,"['IU', 'NIU', 'r.schlegelmilch@uni-bremen.de']",OSF

Whilst PoTS is associated with impaired daily functioning, burdensome fatigue and poor quality of life, little research has been undertaken to examine how patients attempt to share their debilitating, daily symptom experiences with others. The current study therefore employed narrative analysis to explore how people with PoTS communicated understandings of their chronic illness within the re-telling of their own diagnostic stories. Method: A purposeful sample of 20 YouTube vlogs, triangulated alongside semi-structured interviews of 15 people diagnosed with PoTS (Mean Age= 35.3, SD= 12.1), were coded through NVIVO. The conduct of narrative analysis was guided through the adoption of a performative approach (Meraz et al., 2019). Rigour was achieved through reflexive note generation, numerous team analysis discussions and data triangulation. Findings: Within their narratives, storytellers constructed and drew upon socio-medical frameworks- those surrounding the autonomic nervous system- to communicate understandings of their PoTS to others and to account for their widespread symptom experiences. Through these models, storytellers depicted experiencing symptoms as a heightened bodily awareness, through the portrayal of their PoTS as a perceived ‘disruption’ to their body’s unconscious pathways. Storytellers employed metaphors and personification to allocate blame towards their bodies for their disrupted daily functioning. Conclusion: The identification of the autonomic nervous system- as a common, patient-derived socio-medical ontology- ultimately serves as an effective explanatory model for researchers to utilise for the development of specific, new patient acceptable interventions for PoTS.",https://osf.io/dm6gc/,2023-09-11T12:15:34.895204,"['AU', 'j.hogg@northumbria.ac.uk', 'USA', ' State', 'State', 'UK']",OSF

Whilst our previous work demonstrated that 10-month-old infants recruited right-lateralised regions of the PFC and parietal cortex when inhibition was required, the current study suggests that by 16-months, toddlers recruit the left superior parietal gyrus, the right inferior frontal gyrus, and bilateral regions of the dorsolateral PFC and orbital frontal cortex. Although there was no longitudinal change in response inhibition performance, more widespread, bilateral regions of the PFC were recruited during response inhibition at 16-months compared to 10 months. We acknowledge the need for replication of these results.

However, and to our knowledge, attempts to validate this possibility have remained inconclusive so far, and results remain focused on offline behavioral decisions made after stimulus appearance. In the present paper, we present an eye-tracking protocol for exploring the cognitive processes preceding behavioral responses in an interval comparison task, where participants viewed two consecutive intervals and had to decide whether it speeded up (first interval longer than second) or slowed down (second interval longer). Our main concern was disentangling oculomotor responses to the visual stimulus itself from correlates of duration-relate to judgements. To achieve this, we defined three consecutive time windows based on critical events: baseline onset, onset of the first interval, onset of second interval, end of stimulus. We then extracted traditional oculomotor measures for each (number of fixations, pupil size), and focused on time-window-related changes to separate the responses to the visual stimulus from those related to interval comparison per se. As we show in the illustrative results, eye-tracking data showed significant differences that were consistent with behavioral results, raising hypotheses on the mechanisms engaged. Our protocol is embryonic and will require many improvements, but it represents an important step forward in the current state-of-art.",https://psyarxiv.com/3axfb/,2023-09-11T09:08:43.251984,"['AU', 'ODU', 'UC', 'ND', 'UT']",OSF

help-seeking among international and domestic students, while formal help-seeking was not popular;
(2) international students were more likely to overcome emotional difficulties alone and seek help
on the Internet than domestic students; (3) acculturative stress was a positive predictor of formal,

help-seeking behaviors or among domestic students; and (4) depression was negatively correlated

However, about half of the country’s active population remains in agriculture. In order to characterize
the role of agriculture and livestock in Vietnam’s structural transformation, we assess ongoing
dynamics at three complementary scales: national, sectoral (agriculture and livestock) and local
(district of Bavi). We show that the transition since Doi Moi (Renovation) has given rise to a political
economy that provides incentives to industries and services. However, labor abundance (due to
population density) and limited land availability (85% of agricultural land is composed of less than 1
ha farms) have slowed the canonical structural transformation, and widened income inequality
between agriculture and non-agricultural workers. In this ‘Lewis trap’ context, intensive livestock (as it
is the case for aquaculture and horticulture) has played a significant role in increasing labor and land
productivity, offering some perspectives to secure smallholder agricultural systems. But the
emergence of those very intensive systems producing a lot of effluents has in the same time
jeopardized sustainable development of rural and peri-urban areas. More recently, the political shift
towards industrial corporate agriculture and large-scale farming has increased this pressure on the
environment, and endangered inclusive agricultural development. Today, smallholder farming and
rural communities encounter many challenges to exploit resources efficiently and gain access to input
markets to achieve higher productivity and value added. To avoid the risk of poverty trap and to
pursue a sustainable and inclusive development over the long run, deeper and wider reforms are

central government and with the participation of the local governments, private sector and grassroots
people in the framework of the GMS Program. So far there has been no major research either in Vietnamese

regionalisation in three Vietnam’s border towns in the First-Generation GMS Economic Corridor Town
Development Project. Employing analytical framework based on relevant International Relations and
interdisciplinary theories, and a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, the thesis finds that the GMS
regionalisation is a combination of ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ processes. The thesis commences by
highlighting the significance of the Mekong River to the development of the region. Then various multilateral
cooperative schemes are explored to generate a complete picture of regional cooperation. It is concluded
that many multilateral mechanisms with little progress may have negative impacts on the regionalisation in
the GMS. Among 13 schemes in the GMS, GMS Program is considered as one of the most well-known
subregional cooperation schemes. The GMS Program came to existence just in time to assist the Mekong
riparian states to integrate better into the regional and international markets in the context that there were
new developments both at the regional and world’s levels. In the case of Vietnam, the GMS Program has
given Hanoi an option to carry on its omni-directional foreign policy and helped it consolidate its existing
relationships with its traditional and neighbouring partners. Notably, regionalisation is occurring in some
parts of the country where GMS projects have been implemented. Regionalisation can be best observed in
economic space where there are intensive interactions among people under various dimensions enabled
by favourable policies. Although regionalisation promises to bring new cooperative opportunities in the
GMS, regionalisation in the GMS will continue to meet new challenges from growing natural and man-made
threats to the Mekong River. Further, the involvement of outsiders is also a real challenge to the regionbuilding

However, the performance and dependability of engine components tend to deteriorate over their operational lifespan. This degradation adversely affects their reliability and overall efficiency. To proactively address maintenance requirements and mitigate the risk of engine failure, accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) becomes imperative. Precise estimation of RUL empowers effective maintenance planning, minimizing potential risks and reducing downtime caused by engine malfunctions. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is a Deep Learning technique that is widely used for predicting accurate RUL as LSTM are capable of learning long-term dependencies which can be useful in the case of large data-driven predictions. This paper proposes an LSTM model with LSTM, dropout, and fully connected layers for predicting the RUL of Aircraft Turbofan Engines using the CMAPSS turbofan Jet engine degradation dataset provided by NASA. The primary architecture of the proposed model has four layers of LSTM and Dropout each and a fully connected layer for output, with tanh, sigmoid, and relu as primary activation functions. The C-MAPSS dataset consists of four each training and testing datasets. Datasets consisting of 26 features including Engine id, Number of cycles, Operational settings, and Sensor data are pre-processed and brought down to relevant features with the help of a correlation matrix. Further, the dataset is transformed according to the window size of the LSTM model, which makes it easy to use it for training. Undergoes training and testing on pre-processed sub-datasets, and the obtained results are compared against existing methods that have used the same dataset in their research work.

From a population-coding perspective, we outline how extrapolation can be achieved by a forwards shift in the ‘population position estimate’ – the represented position of an object, encoded in distributed neural activity. We identify three general mechanisms underlying such shifts, involving asymmetries in excitation, inhibition, and connectivity. We consider specific examples in different visual regions, as well as how motion extrapolation can be achieved during inter-regional signaling, and how asymmetric connectivity patterns which support extrapolation can emerge spontaneously from local synaptic learning rules.

However, when the actual content does not match the expectation, costly reanalysis processes are required. Previous work has suggested that experience with unexpected syntactic structures reduces such repair costs, a phenomenon referred to as syntactic adaptation or updating. However, other studies have failed to replicate these effects. We investigated (a) whether there was syntactic updating at the group level and whether it persisted over time; and (b) whether there were stable individual differences in syntactic ambiguity resolution and cognitive abilities that could potentially lead to individual variation in syntactic updating. Participants were exposed to different distributions of expected and unexpected completions of temporarily ambiguous sentences and tested on whether that experience changed their processing of unexpected sentence structures.

Participants also completed assessments of cognitive abilities and extent of language experience. At the group level, we did not observe any significant syntactic updating. At the individual level, we found that syntactic ambiguity resolution was stable within a session but not across sessions. Individual differences in cognitive abilities and language experience did not correlate with syntactic ambiguity resolution or updating.

Spenser’s superb creative skills profoundly influenced his contemporaries and the English poets of later generations. Nevertheless, the translation of Spenser’s sonnets began exceedingly late in China with few results. Guided by the horizon of expectation in reception aesthetics, this study compared Cao Minglun and Hu Jialuan’s versions of Amoretti Sonnet 67 (Amoretti 67) based on their content, rhyme, and language style. The main question is to understand what horizons of expectations Hu and Cao’s translations reflect based on reception aesthetics, and how do Hu and Cao’s horizons fuse with the original author’s horizon of expectation? Guided by translators’ vision of expectation, Hu emphasized that both the content and style of the translation should be faithful to the original text. Thus, Hu’s translation is the closest to the original poem. Contrarily, Cao’s translation sought a balance between the original text and the translation. Cao aimed to maintain the content and format of the original poetry while capitalizing on the strengths of the Chinese language. Both Chinese versions embody their translator’s values. The significance of this study extends to its implications for Chinese readers delving into Spenser’s poetic world. Analyzing Cao and Hu’s diverse strategies empowers readers to navigate Amoretti 67’s depth, fostering understanding of Spenser’s artistry and the intricacies of translation.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ge95b/,2023-09-12T19:41:56.702612,['chweefang@upm.edu.my'],OSF

Unlike Wordsworth, who worshipped nature, Robert Frost presented man as the focal point in most of his poems; his treatment of nature was a mixed feeling – both a sense of awe and mysticism. Man, nature, and environment are the three issues that come under repeated scrutiny in most of his poems, where he explores the effect of man on his environment and vice-versa. His portrayal of the situation where human beings grapple their way out patiently in their disagreeable mood – makes it more relevant in today’s context. Robert Frost reveals man – the nature dichotomy, the interrelationship between them to strike tragic depths though not communicative but always at loggerheads. This poem under study stretches afar and meanders into a quintessential search for truth and problems confronting man pitted against nature. The main aim of this article is to unravel his ambivalent views of nature, human character, and the mutual interrelationship between them with a specific focus on the poem “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening” which, expresses profound clarification on human experience against the backdrop of nature. What is Robert Frost’s understanding of nature? Why is man endlessly confronting with nature/surroundings? Does man’s inner strength have any role to play are some of the questions that seek to find out in this study. A detailed analysis of this poem reveals man’s quest for truth in the contemporary consumeristic culture, offering little space for man to be in harmony with nature. Robert Frost universalized this encounter with nature",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x7jba/,2023-09-12T19:41:01.272598,['mschagla@yahoo.com'],OSF

This study intends to reveal the methods used in translating the language that contributed to the humorous effect in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid graphic series. Hopefully, this study will contribute to the literature on translating Humour into Arabic and determine whether translating Humour into Arabic effectively conveys its intended meaning beyond the language barrier. Random but funny chunks from various volumes were picked as the data source. Leppihalme’s (1997)   humour translation model was used to analyse the data. A reading experiment was conducted with 17 teenagers to rate some chosen translated and non-translated sections to assess whether the methods succeeded. Then the obtained data were also subjected to a comparative mixed analysis. According to the analysis, there appears to be a repeating approach used to translate the text into Arabic, and this method is also used to translate potentially funny parts regardless of what context and co-text could contribute to the sense of humour effect. According to the findings, 37 individuals in both monolingual and bilingual groups thought the given Arabic-translated parts were not funny at all.

By shedding light on the pedagogical promise of monolingual corpora in inverse translation instruction, this research underscores the critical need to integrate this tool into translator training curricula, thereby amplifying the translation competencies of trainees. The central research inquiry is as follows: How does using a monolingual corpus enhance the performance of students engaged in inverse translation of collocations from Arabic to English within the context of political and media texts? The researchers focused on two groups of female students specializing in political and media translation at the College of Language Sciences, King Saud University. These groups, a control and an experimental one, were meticulously trained with different references—while the control group relied on conventional bilingual dictionaries, the experimental group employed monolingual corpora as their primary translation references—the assessment criterion centered on translating a newspaper text. The noteworthy outcome of this comparative analysis was that the experimental group consistently outperformed their counterparts in the control group by leveraging monolingual corpora. The findings from this research offer precise guidance to enhance the efficiency of translation training programs. Moreover, the study equips translators with essential skills and competencies and elevates the quality of translation training programs.",https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8wjyn/,2023-09-12T13:29:45.335577,['shubaily@ksu.edu.sa'],OSF

In a universe dominated by the second law of thermodynamics, entropy - the inherent tendency towards disorder - is an inescapable constant. However, life, in its essence, challenges this tendency, maintaining order and complexity through free energy. This energy, especially human energy, is not only the vital force that sustains biological processes but is also the primary energy source that fuels the complex structures and operations of contemporary societies. For 95% of humanity's historical time, human energy was channeled very differently than it is today. It was primarily directed towards group cohesion, life sustenance, and maintaining balance with the surrounding environment. Life in small cohesive groups allowed for a balanced use of energy, resisting entropic forces. However, with the transition to post-agricultural societies, there was a drastic shift in how this energy is utilized. The demands of modern society, with its emphasis on production, transportation, marketing, and consumption, require an unprecedented amount of human energy. This energy is extracted from individuals. This essay seeks to explore this dynamic, questioning the diversion of human energy from its primary purpose and the need to realign our societies to recognize the intrinsic value of human energy in the form of labor. In an entropic universe, where disorder is the norm, human energy is our greatest defense against chaos. Therefore, it is imperative that we recognize its centrality in our lives and societies.

Specifically, issue-based, affective, and perceived societal polarization are differentially predicted by trust in democratic institutions (i.e., government, judiciary, and media), constructive patriotism, and social identity. Constructive patriotism and trust in institutions predicted issue-based and affective polarization, whereas social identity predicted only issue-based polarization. These effects vary across pro- and anti-reform individuals. Perceived societal polarization was predicted by generalized trust and universalism/benevolence values across the polarized camps. These types of polarization differentially predicted downstream consequences of polarization–conflict management attitudes, acts of, and responses to, civil protests, and outgroup attitudes.

We classify 134 countries into four development categories - high development, medium development, low development, and least development based on thirteen development and energy indicators. Using the quadratic plateau model, we estimate that an energy threshold of 94 GJ (±15) and an income threshold of $28,679 (±4179)  is necessary for meeting sustained levels of development defined by indicators for health, education, and infrastructure. We construct baseline scenarios for convergence to, or divergence from, these and other threshold values drawn from the literature, for each development category.  Emissions constraints are then imposed in the form of the remaining carbon budget corresponding to the temperature targets of the Paris Agreement to assess the degree of energy-emissions and energy-GDP decoupling that would be required to meet these targets without reliance on carbon-dioxide removal. Our results show that limiting warming to well below 2 deg. C and o 1.5 deg. C requires significantly higher effort across all regions, with the global effort differing only marginally across scenarios, irrespective of whether energy and climate equity are considered or not.

Political science, sociology, economics, and psychology have explored many dimensions of this phenomenon, yet a critical piece of the puzzle is still missing: what cognitive and neural mechanisms in the brain mediate between these threats and responsiveness to political messages? To answer this question, here, we present a theory that combines cognitive neuroscience theories, namely stress-induced memory shift and competitive cognitive processes, with political science. Our Threat-based Neural Switch Theory posits that the processing of political information, similarly to other information processing, is shaped by the competitive interaction between goal-directed and habitual processes. Threats, also encompassing resource overload, can shift neural networks towards receptiveness to oversimplified political messages. This theory sets out a research program aimed at discovering the cognitive and neural underpinning of how situational factors alter brain functions and modify political information processing.",https://psyarxiv.com/sxjd2/,2023-09-10T14:56:21.088024,"[' State', 'UL', 'Brown', 'UK', 'State', 'Princeton University', 'PC']",OSF

By tailoring the coherent mode interference, the spectral response of the devices is engineered to achieve optical analogues of Rabi splitting with anti-crossing behavior in the resonances. Transitions between the Lorentzian, Fano, and Rabi splitting spectral lineshapes are achieved by simply changing the phase shift along the waveguide connecting the two Sagnac interferometers, revealing interesting physical insights about the evolution of different optical analogues of quantum phenomena.

A comprehensive understanding of their costs, however, remains limited. The primary aim of this study was to accurately estimate and compare the costs associated with TACE, ablation, and SIRT procedures from a hospital perspective.

Methods: A detailed micro-costing study was undertaken in two tertiary hospitals in Brisbane, Australia, over a 12-month period from July 2021 to June 2022. Data were sourced from electronic medical record systems and reviewed by two study nurses to ensure accuracy. Data was collected on all relevant resource use components, including staff time, consumables, medications, and imaging. Resource use items were grouped into pre, intra and post-procedure phases, and unit costs were assigned to estimate costs within each phase. 

Results: In total, 136 patients were included in the study (TACE: n=86; ablation: n=41; SIRT: n=9). The average total costs per admission were $7,079 for TACE, $6,763 for ablation, and $20,782 for SIRT (including both workup and delivery admissions). The primary cost drivers for TACE and ablation were staffing costs, which accounted for 43-45% of the total procedure-related costs. Conversely, consumables were the dominant cost for SIRT, comprising 57% of procedure-related costs. The radiology team incurred the highest staff costs across all three procedures, with the intra-procedure phase being the most resource intensive.

Conclusion: This study represents the first comprehensive micro-costing analysis of TACE, ablation, and SIRT procedures, offering valuable insights for healthcare providers and policymakers.

To explore the underlying representations of phrasal verbs in learners from different first language backgrounds, we conducted a priming study. According to prediction-based approaches to processing, phrasal
verbs that appear in their less frequent construction should lead to stronger priming effects. Results revealed that Chinese and Spanish learners of English held similar constructional preferences to native speakers of English based on verb-type. We found verb-based surprisal
effects for native speakers for the discontinuous construction (e.g., took the trash out) but no such effects for learners.

Re- cent evidence based on the Demonstrative Choice Task (DCT), in which participants couple words with a spatial demonstrative, indicates that demonstrative use, in absence of a communicative context, may also be indicative of experienced or emotional proximity to the self in an imagined mental space. As depression is characterized by increased and maladaptive focus on the self, the DCT may be a simple and reliable way to elicit behaviors that enable inference on the presence of severe depressive states, and allow descriptions of the semantic characteristics of altered self-representation in such states. Using a 300-item DCT, this paper presents two studies investigating the extent to which the DCT can be used to detect depression, and describe its semantic markers. In two independent samples, classification models were trained to classify individuals with high versus low depression symptom severity based on DCT responses. Results showed that lexical choices on the DCT reliably predict depression in both studies. Further, the DCT replicated semantic patterns of negative affect previously observed to be associated with depression.

However, these meta-analyses have differed substantially in TSR-outcome relationships, moderators, and quality, thus complicating the interpretation of these findings. In this preregistered systematic review of meta-analyses plus original second-order meta-analyses (SOMAs), we aimed to (a) synthesize the meta-analytic evidence on relationships between TSRs and student outcomes, (b) map influential moderators of these relationships, and (c) assess the methodological quality of the meta-analyses. We synthesized over 70 years of educational research in 24 meta-analyses encompassing a total of 116 effect sizes based on more than 2 million prekindergarten and K-12 students. We conducted several three-level SOMAs and found that TSRs had similar strong significant relationships with eight clusters of outcomes: academic achievement, academic emotions, appropriate student behavior, behavior problems, executive functions and self-control, motivation, school belonging and engagement, and student well-being. Age, gender, and informant (student-, peer-, or teacher-assessments) were the most frequently examined moderators in prior research, and our moderator analyses suggested student grade level and social minority status as moderators. We further found large differences in quality between the meta-analyses, and these differences were not associated with the TSR-outcome relationships. These results map the field of TSR research; present their relationships, moderators, and meta-analytic quality; and show how TSRs can contribute to improving outcomes in students via relationship building.

Results indicated that participants generally viewed traditional “personality disorders” terminology favorably compared to other terms in regard to both scientific accuracy and stigma. “Interpersonal disorders” terminology was also viewed more favorably overall than many other terms, whereas “dark triad” terminology was viewed negatively overall.

This study evaluated the pilot feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of a Spanish-translated, web-based cognitive bias modification for interpretation intervention with surface-level cultural enhancements (called MindTrails-Spanish) in an online sample of Spanish-speaking Latinx individuals with a history of anxiety. Bilingual English/Spanish-speaking individuals were randomized to receive an email invitation for either the standard English version of MindTrails (MindTrails-English) or the Spanish version of MindTrails (MindTrails-Spanish-Bilingual). Separately, monolingual Spanish-speaking individuals were allocated to receive an invitation for the Spanish version of MindTrails (MindTrails-Spanish-Monolingual). Participants were asked to complete one MindTrails session per week for two weeks, and assessment measures at pre- and post-intervention to assess change in positive interpretation bias, negative interpretation bias, anxiety symptoms (using two separate measures), and overall perceptions of MindTrails. Results were compared to a priori benchmarks of clinically meaningful outcomes. All three conditions met benchmarks for feasibility and primary acceptability items. The MindTrails-Spanish-Bilingual condition met benchmarks for improvements in all four intervention outcomes, whereas the MindTrails-Spanish-Monolingual condition met benchmarks for two (negative interpretation bias and one of the two anxiety measures). Findings support the feasibility and acceptability of MindTrails-Spanish with Spanish-speaking Latinx individuals.

This has led to debate about whether shared or distinct mechanisms lead infants to look longer toward unexpected events (the violation-of-expectation response, or VOE) versus visually novel events (the perceptual novelty response, or PN). Here, we studied both looking behaviors using meta-analysis of condition-level data (from 34 papers, 78 conditions, and 1915 infants) and mega-analysis of infant-level data (from 25 papers, 60 conditions, and 1482 infants) from prior studies of infants’ understanding of agents and objects. First, we estimated VOE and PN in the same data and found that showing infants an unexpected event drove their looking behavior as reliably as showing infants a visually novel event. Second, we tested whether VOE and PN are supported by similar or distinct mechanisms. Under the hypothesis that both responses are driven by a common mechanism, the same factors should predict the size of both effects. However, these responses were moderated by different predictors. The PN effect was larger after infants were habituated instead of familiarized, and did not differ depending on infant age. The VOE effect, in contrast, was not moderated by habituation vs familiarization and was larger for younger infants. These findings suggest that these two responses reflect distinct drivers of infant visual attention",https://psyarxiv.com/kx76y/,2023-09-08T21:55:54.323131,"['Johns Hopkins University', ' State', 'MIT', 'State', 'sliu@jhu.edu', 'Hopkins']",OSF

For example, the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics was for loophole-free experiments that tested physicist John S. Bell’s inequality theorem. These experiments employed the logic of conducting local experiments to obtain local evidence (local input - cause - local output) to contradict local realistic theories of nature in order to validate quantum mechanics as a fundamental nonlocal theory. Be that as it may, there was one loophole that was wittingly not tested by the Nobel laureates. The notable exception was Bell’s “super-deterministic” loophole which was tested in the nonlocal no-go Tempt Destiny Experiment (nonlocal input - cause - local output) from 2000-2012. The unambiguous empirical evidence obtained revealed two mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive predetermined nonlocal hidden variables that prohibit the experimenter from conducting all local experiments. Failure to account for nature’s two fundamental variables as causal functions inherently leads to false-positive and false-negative empirical evidence thus compromising the integrity of science. Furthermore, the mistaken assumption that said variables are trivial functions of sentient beings instead of fundamental mechanical functions of nature has inadvertently led to the creation of a new species otherwise known as “artificial intelligence”.",https://osf.io/he8ry/,2023-09-08T22:04:27.181634,"['USA', 'msm@prephysics.com']",OSF

Despite this prediction, past studies have focused on the average effects of valued living on hedonic well-being and found positive associations. In order to examine the heterogeneity of the within-person links of values-based action with hedonic well-being and the possibility of negative associations, we used intensive experience sampling methods (participants (n) = 425; 71.76% female; age = M(SD) = 22.20 (6.85); sampling design: 3-4 prompts per day; total measurements (n) = 6,456). Time series and meta-analytic models revealed that increases in values-based living were positively related to hedonic well-being, but the heterogeneity in this effect was so great (I2 &gt; .80) that the average estimate did not apply to many people. Indeed, for some, valued action was associated with little joy and/or much sadness. A variety of aggregation methods based on idiographic models were examined. A sub-group was identified, which we labeled the ‘Stoics,’ for whom engagement in valued action in daily life was not contingent on sadness or joyfulness, unlike the Non-Stoics, as revealed in within-person networks. While overall levels of affect, valued action, and stressful events were the same in the two groups, network analysis further revealed that for Stoics, stressful situations were linked to valued action, but not hedonic well-being. For Non-Stoics, valued action was less likely in stressful situations, but when valued action did occur it was associated with more joy and less sadness.

We engaged 1,158 expectant women who completed the STAI and other assessments to determine criterion validity. Our methodology incorporated item response theory to select the most discriminating items for pregnant people, confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the fit of the factor solution for the abbreviated versions, and k-fold cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models. Additionally, Bland-Altman regressions and plots assisted in gauging score accuracy, and receiver operating characteristic analyses determined discriminative validity.

information processing in social interactions is complex and situation-specific. Reductionist
approaches and oversimplified measures of these capacities in the lab do not do this complexity
justice. While there is a long-standing research tradition studying the two capacities as independent,
recent evidence from naturalistic social tasks shows that under certain task demands, neural networks
underlying empathy and ToM-processing do interact.
In this exploratory graph-theoretic network analysis, we investigate how neural network organization
is dynamically modulated when processing affective and cognitive stimuli in isolation and interaction.
In a sample of 143 adults, we used a naturalistic social fMRI video task to explore the modulation of
neural network organization in empathy, ToM, and their interaction. Using beta-series correlation, we
calculated seed-based functional connectivity and condition-specific voxel-wise degree centrality.
During empathic processing, we observed network hubs in the right middle frontal gyrus and angular
gyrus and a network encompassing the left superior medial frontal, orbitofrontal cortex, and inferior
frontal gyrus during ToM processing. Interestingly, the right middle frontal gyrus also showed the
highest voxel-wise degree centrality for the interaction of empathy and ToM.
Results from our degree centrality and seed-based functional connectivity analysis show dynamic
changes in the overall network configuration underlying the interaction of empathy and ToM. Network
hubs underlying empathic processing (right middle frontal gyrus) also mediate the interaction of social
affect and cognition, and this effect is driven by the emotional modulation of ToM processing
(processing emotional and ToM content simultaneously). These hub areas are situated in highly
interconnected networks and have been implicated in domain-specific and domain-general processing,
such as attentional control. Bottom-up attentional switching might be an important mechanism driving
cross-network interaction, in turn enabling behavioral adaptation to changing environmental demands
in naturalistic social cognition.",https://psyarxiv.com/c6gsz/,2023-09-08T18:29:52.341578,['lara.maliske@tu-dresden.de'],OSF

Across 183 UK-based participants (Mage = 32.71 years, SD = 10.89), and after controlling for demographic factors and attitudes pertaining to IPV and individuals with disabilities, more punitive judgements (e.g., less victim blame) were reported in vignettes whereby the perpetrator was [1] male, and [2] was not disabled. There were no interaction effects. With results aligning with our hypotheses, we must consider whether these findings reflect the result of typical societal depictions of perpetrators of IPV as being able-bodied men; with depictions that fall out of this scope providing potential mitigations to the severity of IPV.

It is therefore important for teachers to be able to assess children’s language skills directly, especially if they are concerned about their learning. 
Methods. We report the development and standardization of a mobile App, LanguageScreen (OxEd and Assessment, 2022), that can be used by education professionals to assess children’s language ability.
Methods. The standardization includes data from approximately 350,000 children aged 3:06 to 8:11 years who have been screened using LanguageScreen. for receptive and expressive language skills using LanguageScreen.   Rasch scaling was used to select items of appropriate difficulty on a single unidimensional scale.
Results. The test is shown to have excellent psychometric properties including high reliability, good fit to the Rasch model and minimal differential item functioning across key student groups.   Girls outperformed boys and children with English as an additional language scored less well than monolingual English speakers. 
Conclusions. LanguageScreen provides a highly reliable and, child-friendly means of identifying and monitoring the progress of children with language difficulties andthat is easy to use.

Empirical knowledge of psychopathy is often misrepresented in the media and miscommunicated to the general public. This can have practical implications in legal settings. This research investigated how the labels used when discussing individuals characterised by psychopathic traits impacts lay judgements and attributions of them. 

Methods
Participants (n = 477) read a randomised vignette that differed by the sex of the depicted character and the label used to describe them; namely ‘no label’, ‘having a clinical diagnosis’, and ‘displaying psychopathic personality traits’. Measures of mental health stigma and baseline beliefs about psychopathy were used as moderator variables.

Results
Results indicated that participants judged male (relative to female) characters, and those labelled as having either a psychopathy diagnosis or psychopathic personality traits (relative to no label conditions) more harshly. No interaction was found between these main effects, and neither mental health stigma nor beliefs about psychopathy moderated these differences. 

Conclusion
We call for more education around psychopathy targeted towards the general population; with results conveying international practical applications around the reporting and depiction of psychopathy in the media and within legal settings.",https://psyarxiv.com/p78dg/,2023-09-08T14:53:05.234964,"['k.vione@derby.ac.uk', 'UK', 'GB']",OSF

Because of the multifaceted nature of social cognition, deficits might be only observed when assessing specific facets of social cognition and under sufficiently demanding conditions. This study examined self-other distinction performance, a key facet lying at the core of the attachment-based model of mentalizing (Fonagy &amp; Luyten, 2009). Twenty-one forensic inpatients with ASPD and 19 participants from the community completed a visual perspective-taking paradigm allowing to tease apart self-other priority (i.e., how self-focused one is) from self-other distinction performance (i.e., how much one confuses his with others’ mental states). The ASPD group made significantly more errors at handling conflicting self-other viewpoints by enforcing self-other distinction (19%) than the control group (4%), but the ASPD group was not significantly more self-focused. In contrast, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index self-report scale did not differentiate the two groups. However, a novel measure of self-other distinction based on Empathic concern (i.e., the tendency to experience feelings of concern and compassion for others) and Personal distress subscales (i.e., the tendency to experience personal distress in response to the distress of others) did differentiate the two groups, albeit to a significantly lower extent than the objective measure of self-other distinction. Altogether, these findings are in line with the theory that there is a self-other distinction deficit in ASPD and advocate for psychometric approaches embracing the multifaceted nature of social cognition and the need for objective measures with sufficient sensitivity.",https://osf.io/s485w/,2023-09-08T14:26:21.491144,[],OSF

But to act effectively we need to accurately sense what we can and cannot control. Classic theories across cognitive science suppose that this ‘sense of agency’ is constructed from the sensorimotor signals we experience as we interact with our surroundings. But these sensorimotor signals are inherently ambiguous, and can provide us with a distorted picture of what we can and cannot influence.  Here we investigate one way that agents like us might overcome the inherent ambiguity of these signals: by combining noisy sensorimotor evidence with prior beliefs about control acquired through explicit communication with others. Using novel tools to measure and model control decisions, we find that explicit beliefs about the controllability of the environment alter both the sensitivity and bias of agentic choices; meaning that we are both better at detecting and more biased to feel control when we are told to expect it. These seemingly paradoxical effects on agentic choices can be captured by a computational model where expecting to be in control exaggerates the sensitivity or ‘gain’ of the mechanisms we use to detect our influence over our surroundings – making us increasingly sensitised to both true and illusory signs of agency. In combination, these results reveal a cognitive and computational mechanism that allows public communication about what we can and cannot influence to reshape our private sense of control.",https://psyarxiv.com/4jxcv/,2023-09-08T13:53:01.996812,"['UK', 'd.yon@bbk.ac.uk']",OSF

We investigate whether safeguards implemented in these chatbots contribute to the censorship of information that is viewed as harmful by the regime, in particular information about Vladimir Putin and the Russian war against Ukraine, and whether these safeguards enable the generation of false claims, in particular in relation to the regime's internal and external opponents. To detect whether LLM safeguards reiterate political bias, the article compares the outputs of prompts focusing on Putin's regime and the ones dealing with the Russian opposition and the US and Ukrainian politicians. It also examines whether the degree of bias varies depending on the language of the prompt and compares outputs concerning political personalities and issues across three languages: Russian, Ukrainian, and English. The results reveal significant disparities in how individual chatbots withhold politics-related information or produce false claims in relation to it. Notably, Bard consistently refused to respond to queries about Vladimir Putin in Russian, even when the relevant information was accessible via Google Search, and generally followed the censorship guidelines that, according to Yandex-related data leaks, were issued by the Russian authorities. In terms of false claims, we find substantial variation across languages with Ukrainian and Russian prompts generating false information more often and Bard being more prone to produce false claims in relation to Russian regime opponents (e.g., Navalny or Zelenskyy) than other chatbots.

We apply this lesson to the correspondence principle, and then later justify the lesson (holographic correspondence) without necessitating such spatiotemporal deviations via the law of large numbers in statistics, applied to an average of n quantum measurements. Classical observables are considered to emerge as n approaches infinity. The averaging approach can be interpreted both as a generalization of Bohr's correspondence principle (large number limit) and Planck's correspondence principle (Planck's constant approaching zero). Holographic correspondence and the averaging approach are then re-analyzed in light of preceding works in the correspondence principle. A key consequential lesson is that we should not conflate the nature of fundamental theory observables with that of emergent theory observables, and once this confusion is avoided, the correspondence principle has a solid standing.",https://osf.io/zn356/,2023-09-08T10:26:08.546880,[],OSF

To evaluate the correlation and predictive value between variables using a 3R method. Using the 3R method (a combined application of linear regression, ROC curve analysis, and R software to evaluate the correlation between variables and their predictive value), the ROC curve was introduced into the linear correlation regression analysis, and the R software was used to calculate the regression equation, AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and Jorden index to make a precise and accurate judgment of the correlation between variables.The linear regression model established for two variables with linear correlation was statistically significant, and ROC curve analysis was performed to quantitatively evaluate the predictive value between the variables. ROC curve was introduced into linear correlation regression analysis enabled a more accurate evaluation of the correlation between variables and their predictive value based on precise analysis. the R software was suitable for such analytical work.",https://osf.io/c79tu/,2023-09-08T10:35:41.820232,"['OC', 'henuhh@outlook.com']",OSF

While traditional forms of such assessments require candidates to self-report their characteristics via questionnaire measures, recent research suggests that computers can predict people’s psychological traits from the digital footprints they leave online (e.g., their Facebook profiles, Twitter posts or credit card spending). Although such models become increasingly available via third-party providers, the use of external data in the hiring process poses considerable ethical and legal challenges. In this paper, we examine the predictability of personality traits from models that are trained exclusively on data generated during the recruiting process. Specifically, we leverage information from CVs and free-text answers collected as part of a real-world, high-stakes recruiting process in combination with natural language processing to predict applicants’ Big Five personality traits (N = 8,313 applicants). We show that the models provide consistent moderate predictive accuracy when comparing the machine learning-based predictions with the self-reported personality traits (average r = .25), outperforming recruiter judgments reported in prior literature. Although the models only capture a comparatively small part of the variance in self-reports, our findings suggest that they might still be relevant in practice by showing that automated predictions of personality are just as good (and sometimes better) at predicting key external criteria for job matching (i.e., vocational interests) as self-reported assessments.",https://psyarxiv.com/bc4v9/,2023-09-08T09:36:59.521627,"['RU', 'USA']",OSF

Although the classic view in the field points to different neural substrates underlying beat-based vs. duration-based mechanisms, recent neuroimaging evidence provided support to a unified model wherein these two systems overlap. In line with this, previous research demonstrated that internalized beat cues benefit motor reproduction of longer intervals (&gt; 5.5 s) by reducing underestimation, but little is known about this effect on pure perceptual tasks. The present study was designed to investigate whether and how interval estimation is modulated by available beat cues. To that end, we asked 155 participants to estimate auditory intervals ranging from 500 ms to 10 s, while manipulating the presence of cues before the interval, as well as the reinforcement of these cues by beat-related interference within the interval (vs. beat-unrelated and no interference). Beat cues aided time estimation depending on interval duration: for intervals longer than 5 s, estimation was better in the cue than in the no-cue condition. Specifically, the levels of underestimation decreased in the presence of cues, indicating that beat cues had a facilitating effect on time perception very similar to the one observed previously for time production. Interference had no effects, suggesting that this manipulation was not effective. Our findings are consistent with the idea of cooperation between beat- and duration-based systems and suggest that this cooperation is quite similar across production and perception.",https://psyarxiv.com/ghru5/,2023-09-08T08:44:29.509212,['up@edu.fpce.up.pt'],OSF

As a group of researchers and consultants working at the interface between business and biodiversity, we propose a conceptual model through which private sector contributions to a Nature Positive future could be realised and use it to identify priority research questions. The key questions address: i) sectoral strategic options, ii) methods and approaches individual businesses can implement to inform these strategies, iii) systemic driving forces that influence private sector action, and iv) how outcomes are measured to deliver Nature Positive contributions.

In the current study, we ask whether performance on a face or voice identity matching task can be improved by using multimodal stimuli which add a second modality (voice or face). We find that overall accuracy is higher for face matching than for voices matching. However, contrary to predictions, presenting one unimodal and one multimodal stimulus within a matching task did not improve face or voice matching compared to presenting two unimodal stimuli. Additionally, we find that presenting two multimodal stimuli does not improve accuracy compared to presenting two unimodal face stimuli. Thus, multimodal information does not improve accuracy.

We also performed exploratory multilevel mixed-effects logistic regressions on the relationship of genetic relationships, emotional closeness, communication frequency, and physical distance data with accuracy. A total of 177 participants completed at least one trial (105 “completers” completed all 12 trials). Accuracy was significantly above chance for the 210 completers telepathic/pre-selected trials (50.0% where the chance expectation was 33.3%, p&lt;.001) but not the 630 completers precognitive/post-selected trials (31.9% where the chance expectation was 33.3%, p = .61).

They appear to believe that a cat wearing a dog mask is genuinely a dog (appearance/reality distinction) and that a boy that wears a dress is genuinely a girl (sex/gender constancy). These skills may be affected by a variety of influences: testing methods, training on the constancy of biological traits, child or sibling’s diagnosis of gender dysphoria, and child’s diagnosis of autism.
This study sought to replicate Arthur et al. (2009)’s study showing that experimental lessons emphasising the constancy or otherwise of biological traits affected appearance/reality and sex/gender constancy performance.  It examined the influence of school lessons with content on sex/gender stereotyping and pro/anti constancy on young English children (mean age 5;6 years, N = 58)’s performance on appearance/reality and sex/gender constancy tasks.
Children performed above chance on sex/gender stability (change over time) but below chance on sex/gender constancy and appearance/reality tasks (change due to superficial alterations). These scores are comparable to almost all previous studies. Children’s scores were not influenced by school lesson content, though not all schools provided content. 
Conclusions are drawn about the effect of lesson content, which may be too diffuse and long term to affect performance.

I find that deficits have not directly led to higher interest rates, crowding out or inflation in these two nations. 

The findings emphasise the importance for monetarily sovereign governments to prioritise addressing socio-economic issues faced by citizens rather than being overly concerned about deficits on their own.

Previous research has shown that music evokes strong emotional responses that persist across the lifespan and over time. However, the mechanisms underlying the emotional effects of music, particularly in older adults, are largely unknown. One purported mechanism by which music evokes emotions is episodic memory – that is, music evokes memories that then lead to emotional responses. In the present study, we investigated whether memory-evoking music induces stronger and longer-lasting emotional responses than music that is not associated with memories, and whether these emotional responses differ between younger and older adults. 
Methods. Older (N=30) and younger adults (N=30) listened to two blocks of self-selected music (one block of memory-evoking music and one block of familiar but non-memory-evoking music). Participants reported their emotions prior to listening and at three timepoints post-listening. 
Results. Overall, older adults reported higher levels of positive affect than younger adults. For both groups, positive affect increased after listening to both memory-evoking and non-memory-evoking music. However, negative affect only increased after listening to memory-evoking music. 
Conclusions. These results suggest that both memory-evoking and non-memory-evoking music generate strong emotions across the lifespan, but music that conjures personal memories is more likely to elicit mixed positive and negative emotions. Our results have important clinical implications when designing music-based interventions for mood and affect, particularly in older adult populations.",https://psyarxiv.com/tk4gh/,2023-09-07T21:03:44.596427,"['University of Kentucky', 'amybelfi@mst.edu', 'Missouri University of Science and Technology', 'Missouri University of Science and Technology ']",OSF

We found surprisingly little support for many widely-recommended strategies (e.g., performing random acts of kindness).

We analyze the temporal effects in explaining the diminishing self-rated health (SRH), how social, economic, and demographic factors contribute to the health reversal, and how SRH inequalities have changed over time.

Method: We analyzed 29 waves of cross-section data from the General Social Survey (1972-2018, N = 46,133). This study employed Bayesian Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort models and frequentist Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort Cross-Classified Random Effect models (HAPC-CCRM) to estimate age, period, and cohort effects. We discuss how Bayesian Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort can resolve the age-period-cohort identification problem.

Results: Both frequentist and Bayesian models show an-inverted U-shaped period effect on SRH. Results affirm a health decline at the turn of the 21st century. This downward trend is present regardless of gender, race, income, education, and employment status. While income, education, and employment disparities in SRH have widened in the last two decades, we find that racial and gender gaps in SRH have shrunk in the same period due to the diminishing SRH advantage of white males. Nevertheless, racial inequalities in SRH persist, and the SRH decline applies to all racial, gender, and socio-economically disadvantaged groups.

Conclusion: Consistent with a negative epidemiological trend in mortality and morbidity in the US, SRH has worsened in the 21st century after considering age and cohort effects. Income and education remain significant determinants of self-rated health. We discuss how the ongoing opioid crisis and social dislocation of the white working class since the late 1990s could be the culprits of declining SRH.

We present the hitherto most comprehensive study examining QRPs across countries and main scholarly fields. We survey perception, use, prevalence and predictors of QRP among 3,402 researchers in Denmark and 1,307 in the UK, USA, Croatia and Austria. 
Results reveal remarkably similar response patterns among Danish and international respondents (τ = 0.85). Self-reported use indicates whether respondents have used a QRP in recent publications. Overall, 9 out of 10 admitted having used at least one QRP. Median use is three out of nine QRP-items. Response patterns were also similar across fields, except for arts and humanities where rates were somewhat lower. Self-reported prevalence reflects the frequency of use. On average, prevalence rates were roughly three times lower compared to self-reported use. Findings indicated that self-report patterns were influenced by perceived social acceptability of QRPs. Results suggest that within a restricted time period most researchers use different types QRPs. The prevalence estimates, however, do not suggest outright systematic use of specific QRPs. 
Perceived pressure was the strongest systemic predictor for prevalence. Conversely, more attention locally to research cultures, as well as academic age were negatively related to prevalence. Finally, the personality traits conscientiousness and agreeableness were also inversely associated with self-reported prevalence.

This paper proposes a new semantic approach to trace the devaluation process in American culture, where occupation titles appear in scholarly and public discourses with varied semantic proximity to gender- and prestige-signaling phrases over time. Decade-specific occupation embedding (1900-2019) from 127 billion words of American English across genres and a novel decomposition of fixed-effects estimation show a latent cultural bias against women's work, such that an occupation's prestige declines when it becomes increasingly stereotyped as a female job. Penalties appear throughout the period, with the largest effects found in lower-income occupations; most high-income occupations, despite experiencing large increases in female share in recent years, are persistently stereotyped as male professions without a significant prestige loss.

By bypassing the firewall, opponents are occasionally convinced to comply after seeing positive and credible reporting about the regime by banned foreign outlets. The firewall ensures that regime supporters exclusively consume content from domestic outlets and so their compliance is secured via regime propaganda. We label this strategy one of segment-and-rule and show how it maximizes compliance.
